Kumar, presiding member of NCLT, in the March order. Under the new Companies Act, shareholders are required to hold 10% equity to be qualified to file such a petition. The Act does not define equity to mean only ordinary equity.The two Mistry firms own a combined 18.4% of ordinary equity shares of the Tata group holding firm, but their holding falls below 10% when preference shares are taken into account. According to the Tatas, Mistry firms hold only about 2.17% then.Later, in an order passed on 17 April, NCLT said it would not waive the 10% requirement for the Mistry firms to file the petition. It makes sense for Mistry’s firms to approach the appellate body on maintainability and waiver separately as the legal arguments put forward on the two issues were different, said Ramesh Vaidyanathan, founder and managing partner at Advaya Legal, a law firm.The plea on maintainability was based on the fact that equity shareholding of the Mistry firms is above the threshold of 10%. The waiver arguments were on why the tribunal should waive the threshold requirement, said Vaidyanathan. While arguing in favour of the waiver, the Mistry firms had cited concerns on voting and veto rights accorded to Tata trustees on the board of Tata Sons.“Assuming that the petitioners are likely to approach the tribunal on waiver and main petition being dismissed, the tribunal may consider merging the appeal against dismissal of maintainability and waiver. This is because the urgency to deal with this matter is no longer there,” added Vaidyanathan. As the final order of the 17 April hearing is yet to be released, the firms could not have clubbed the waiver and maintainability petitions, said the first of the two people cited earlier.

The volume of daily cashless transactions has increased from Rs150 crore to Rs400 crore per day since the 8 November demonetization of high-value banknotes that created a cash crunch.So far, 38,128 retail outlets have been equipped with point-of-sale (PoS) machines. More than 86% of the outlets have infrastructure for digital payment transactions. “Most of the petrol pumps have opted for digital infrastructure such as micro ATMs and e-wallets since demonetization. However, the cashless drive can be accelerated further with the adoption of BharatQR or a standardized quick response (QR) code across all the retail outlets,” said Sunil Kulkarni, deputy managing director, Oxigen Services (India) Pvt. Ltd, a payment company.To incentivize cashless payments, Pradhan said that the government had on 8 December announced a discount of 0.75% for purchase of petrol/diesel through credit/debit cards and e-wallets, at fuel retail outlets run by OMCs. It came into effect from 13 December.The burden of the discount is being borne by state-owned OMCs Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL).The oil ministry tweeted later in the day that it is exploring options to deliver petroleum products to consumers at their doorsteps on pre-booking. “This would help consumers avoid spending excessive time and long queues at fuel stations,” said the tweet.

-0.52,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is seeking to step up the pace of auctioning power-purchase contracts for wind-energy plants, building on a contest that reaped record-low prices for solar farms earlier this month.The government plans to offer deals covering almost 4 gigawatts of wind capacity in the current fiscal year ending March 2018 in addition to 750 megawatts of solar capacity it will tender next month, Ashvini Kumar, managing director at Solar Energy Corp. of India, the country’s implementing agency for renewable targets, told reporters in New Delhi.Modi is seeking to expand renewables to help balance India’s burgeoning needs for electricity against efforts to clear the skies of pollution. The government has a goal to install 175 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2022 and is prodding local authorities to step up the pace of permitting renewables.“The ministry of new and renewable energy has written to all states to indicate their requirement for green power to consolidate demand, as more tenders would be brought out,” Kumar said.SECI, which conducted Asia’s first onshore wind auction in February, received bids to supply wind power for Rs3.46 (5 US cents) a kilowatt-hour, much lower than feed-in tariffs of Rs4 rupees to Rs5 prevailing across India’s most windy states.Also Read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/m83GjZAfpnMj2T0sMQNhpJ/Green-energy-firms-explore-portfolio-mergers-to-aid-selloff.html"" target=""_blank"">Green energy firms explore portfolio mergers to aid sell-off</a>According to Kumar, the government thinks that 5 gigawatts to 6 gigawatts of wind capacity can be added every fiscal, and companies could be able to reach the government’s goal over the next four years.Modi’s goal calls for a doubling of India’s wind capacity to 60 gigawatts and a 10-fold increase in solar projects to 100 gigawatts.SECI already has planned to offer 750 megawatts of solar projects next month in the sunny state of Rajasthan, anticipating that contest will bring record-low bids. The auction structure forces companies to compete for contracts to sell power from renewable energy plants, encouraging them to reduce prices.The price of solar power in India fell to a record of Rs3.15 a kilowatt-hour last week in an auction for 250 megawatts earlier this month, besting February’s record of Rs3.30 a unit.“The trend in the market should continue, and I would like to think that the market hasn’t bottomed out,” Kumar said when asked if tariffs in the upcoming project could go below the Rs3 mark.Also Read:<a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/Q5Florefv9lbFwnMQhsXpO/Foreign-investors-giving-MA-deals-in-Indias-renewable-ener.html"" target=""_blank""> Foreign investors giving M&amp;A deals in India’s renewable energy sector a miss</a>Timely payments to investors backing green power also will help bring prices lower, the official said. The industry has a guarantee backed by the states, SECI, and the Reserve Bank of India, which is the national central bank. This agreement has been executed with 23 states, and SECI expects the remaining to come on board soon, he added.India’s green-power ambitions have been at risk from loss-making state-run power retailers that aren’t able to buy enough power and have run behind on payments to several domestic and overseas clean-energy companies, racking up deficits of several hundred million dollars.The upcoming 750-megawatt solar park is split into a 500-megawatt project offering five contracts to build 100 megawatts and a 250-megawatt piece where investors can bid chunks of at least 50 megawatts.Kumar said the larger piece was oversubscribed 11 times and the smaller one by 13 times when the bids were submitted by investors on Wednesday. The firms bidding included companies from the Middle East and other locations new to India’s renewables auctions.Infrastructure development and finance group IL&amp;FS has developed the 500-megawatt solar park by acquiring land for installations and building power evacuation systems, while the same has been done for the remaining 250-megawatt portion by Indian conglomerate Adani group.The solar park charges for the IL&amp;FS group facility are Rs0.42 crore a megawatt, while that for the Adani group’s park are Rs0.36 crore, SECI General Manager Sanjay Sharma said.

-0.61,"Mumbai: For Grishma, an Indian software designer, President Donald Trump’s review of the visa programme for bringing highly skilled workers into the United States comes at a bad time.Fresh from gaining a master’s degree in Europe, and with an offer of employment from a well-known US design firm, she was well on her way to fulfilling the ambition of many young Indian IT workers—a dream job in America.But as she waits in the H1B visa queue for the green light, she is caught in a bind. “It’s a weird time to be applying, with all the scrutiny,” said Grishma, who gave only her first name for fear of jeopardising her chances of getting a visa.The United States has already suspended the “expedited processing option” for applicants, under which she may have received a visa in weeks. More broadly, uncertainty over the review announced this week has unsettled Grishma and many others like her.She will have to wait until at least around August to learn her fate, but having accepted the US job offer she is not in a position to apply for positions elsewhere, including in Europe. “It’s pretty debilitating,” Grishma told <i>Reuters</i>. “I’d like to start work to mitigate the financial damage.”Trump’s decision was not a huge surprise, given his election campaign pledge to put American jobs first.Also read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Politics/4ItpsVUuXrtimX2wLZXlnL/H1B-visa-curbs-India-threatens-US-with-trade-retaliation.html"">H-1B visa curbs—India talks tough, signals it may hit back at US</a>But the executive order he signed, though vague in many areas, has prompted thousands of foreign workers already in the United States or applying for visas to work there to re-think their plans. Companies who send them also face huge uncertainty.The concerns are particularly acute in India, where IT firms like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd are top beneficiaries of the H1B visa programme, using it to send computer engineers to service clients in the United States, their largest overseas market.Companies and staff realignExperts say Trump’s order to review visa processes is aimed at firms like TCS, Infosys and Wipro, which from 2005-14 snagged around 86,000 H1B visas, roughly equivalent to the number of H1B visas the United States issues in total each year.Two industry people aware of the matter said Infosys, India’s no. 2 information technology (IT) services company, is applying for just under 1,000 H1B visas this year, which one of the people said was down from 6,500 applications in 2016 and some 9,000 in 2015.It was not clear whether the sharp reduction in 2017 was in direct response to Trump’s presidency, although the company has said for some time it wanted to cut dependence on “fly-in” staff. TCS, Infosys and Wipro said they would not share data on the number of H1B visas they had applied for this year.With fewer visas going to Infosys, more might become available for smaller IT companies and big US tech companies, like Facebook and Microsoft Corp, that typically send in fewer H1B applications each year.US-based immigration lawyer Murali Bashyam, managing partner of Bashyam Spiro LLP which advises and works with small to mid-sized Indian IT firms, said clients had been in contact seeking clarity, while the number of visa applicants had fallen.“I think the reason for that is they get the sense that it’s going to get so much tougher to comply with all of the changes ... that it might not be worth their money,” he said. “There is a fear that radical immigration changes are coming, and if those radical immigration changes come then it could completely change the way IT staffing companies do business.”Bashyam said the number of people on H1B visas already working in the United States who were considering returning to their home country had risen.An engineer working at Cisco, who has been in the United States since 2011, said that three months ago he would not have considered returning to India. But the review of the visa system, and any rule change that revoked the right for his wife to work in the United States on a dependent visa, could force him to change his mind.“If that happens, then I would definitely be interested in going back to India. Even though I’m secure, I don’t want to be in a situation where my wife cannot work,” said the engineer, who declined to be named. “Those who have heavily invested here, who’ve bought houses, property and are still on visas, are afraid.”‘I’m looking eastward’According to Bashyam, some Indians on H1B visas were cancelling plans to return home to visit their families in case they had problems getting back into the United States. “With everything that’s going on, travelling outside the US is the biggest fear for a lot of the H1B workers working in the IT staffing industry,” he said.And the uncertainty is not limited to IT. Trump’s campaign rhetoric around tighter visa rules has led some Indian students considering studying abroad to look beyond the United States, which typically draws in over 1,00,000 Indian students annually.One Canadian official said the number of student visa applications for certain courses in Canada had spiked over 250% since Trump’s election win in November.Akshay Baliga, a management consultant with a H1B visa that is valid until 2018, said he was not considering returning to the United States for work any time soon. “As a professional I’m looking eastward,” said Baliga, now based in India but who earlier studied and lived for years in America.

Companies who send them also face huge uncertainty.The concerns are particularly acute in India, where IT firms like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd are top beneficiaries of the H1B visa programme, using it to send computer engineers to service clients in the United States, their largest overseas market.Companies and staff realignExperts say Trump’s order to review visa processes is aimed at firms like TCS, Infosys and Wipro, which from 2005-14 snagged around 86,000 H1B visas, roughly equivalent to the number of H1B visas the United States issues in total each year.Two industry people aware of the matter said Infosys, India’s no. 2 information technology (IT) services company, is applying for just under 1,000 H1B visas this year, which one of the people said was down from 6,500 applications in 2016 and some 9,000 in 2015.It was not clear whether the sharp reduction in 2017 was in direct response to Trump’s presidency, although the company has said for some time it wanted to cut dependence on “fly-in” staff. TCS, Infosys and Wipro said they would not share data on the number of H1B visas they had applied for this year.With fewer visas going to Infosys, more might become available for smaller IT companies and big US tech companies, like Facebook and Microsoft Corp, that typically send in fewer H1B applications each year.US-based immigration lawyer Murali Bashyam, managing partner of Bashyam Spiro LLP which advises and works with small to mid-sized Indian IT firms, said clients had been in contact seeking clarity, while the number of visa applicants had fallen.“I think the reason for that is they get the sense that it’s going to get so much tougher to comply with all of the changes ... that it might not be worth their money,” he said. “There is a fear that radical immigration changes are coming, and if those radical immigration changes come then it could completely change the way IT staffing companies do business.”Bashyam said the number of people on H1B visas already working in the United States who were considering returning to their home country had risen.An engineer working at Cisco, who has been in the United States since 2011, said that three months ago he would not have considered returning to India. But the review of the visa system, and any rule change that revoked the right for his wife to work in the United States on a dependent visa, could force him to change his mind.“If that happens, then I would definitely be interested in going back to India. Even though I’m secure, I don’t want to be in a situation where my wife cannot work,” said the engineer, who declined to be named. “Those who have heavily invested here, who’ve bought houses, property and are still on visas, are afraid.”‘I’m looking eastward’According to Bashyam, some Indians on H1B visas were cancelling plans to return home to visit their families in case they had problems getting back into the United States. “With everything that’s going on, travelling outside the US is the biggest fear for a lot of the H1B workers working in the IT staffing industry,” he said.And the uncertainty is not limited to IT. Trump’s campaign rhetoric around tighter visa rules has led some Indian students considering studying abroad to look beyond the United States, which typically draws in over 1,00,000 Indian students annually.One Canadian official said the number of student visa applications for certain courses in Canada had spiked over 250% since Trump’s election win in November.Akshay Baliga, a management consultant with a H1B visa that is valid until 2018, said he was not considering returning to the United States for work any time soon. “As a professional I’m looking eastward,” said Baliga, now based in India but who earlier studied and lived for years in America.

Now, an analyst at a foreign brokerage has suggested that the company is better off without the target.ALSO READ: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Money/JbzPzyPMJdV4ZBhqSyxkbK/Has-Infosyss-recovery-dissipated-before-it-even-started.html"" target=""_blank"">Has Infosys’s recovery dissipated before it even started?</a>“Management continues to maintain ‘aspirational’ revenue and margin targets that are increasingly becoming unlikely to be achieved, in our opinion. Given Infy (Infosys) is now guiding to lower levels of both revenue growth and margins in FY18 (2017-18), we think management would be well-served to either amend or drop its aspirational targets,” Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 April. Based on its <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/hI2j9yckPHHX6PkEuKU2PK/Infosys-Q4-earnings-subdued-guidance-lower-for-201718.html"" target=""_blank"">guidance for 2017-18</a>, issued last week, Infosys expects to end the year with revenue of between $10.8 billion and $11.3 billion. Infosys maintains this target is an ambition and the management has no plans to dump it.In April 2015, Infosys first outlined its ambitious target: India’s second largest software firm wanted to become a $20 billion firm with 30% operating margin and to generate $80,000 in revenue from every employee working on a project.  In 2016, it tweaked the deadline to 2020-21. Infosys ended financial year 2015 with $8.7 billion in revenue, 25.9% in operating margin and generated $52,300 per employee.Two years later, Infosys managed a compound annual growth rate of 8.25% to increase its revenue to $10.21 billion but operating margin declined by 120 basis points to 24.7% and revenue per employee slipped to $51,400, making many question CEO Vishal Sikka’s strategy.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Not that Sikka hasn’t delivered. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17;  for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been  the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the “impossible targets.” “The industry is going through a structural change, and to make it worse, you set yourself impossible targets,” said a former EVP, who quit last year. “A large component of a senior executive’s salary is tied to company’s annual growth, which itself is linked to the long-term target.”Infosys says it outlined a target to make its employees work towards a goal and eventually help script a turnaround.“We gave this target because we believed this would help motivate employees, and help the CEO make them work towards a goal,” one board member, who was part of the goal-setting exercise, said on  condition of anonymity. “Looking back, I’m still not sure if it was a wrong step. I’m still on the fence,  thinking how and what we could have done better to make sure hopes did not run high and employees did not come under pressure.”One of the things Infosys could have avoided was linking Sikka’s salary to the target, said the second executive who quit, a former SVP. This seemed to suggest that  this was much more than an aspirational target, as the CEO himself has repeatedly said. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/nZzaphFLFUOqP1EuegR9EL/Infosys-CEO-Vishal-Sikka-takes-home-only-61-of-eligible-pay.html"" target=""_blank"">A weak performance in this year hurt Sikka</a>, who earned $6.8 million in 2016-17, less than the $7.3 million he earned in 2015-16.

It performs trend analysis, compiles crime and criminal profiles and analyses the behaviour of suspected offenders—all with accompanying graphics. CMAPs also has a security module for VIP threat rating, based on vulnerability of the potential target and the security deployed, and advanced predictive analysis, among other features.A prototype of the standalone version was installed at the Delhi Police control room in June 2015. The software’s statistical models and algorithms today help the police carry out “predictive policing” to forecast where the next crime is likely to occur, much like in cities such as London, Los Angeles, Kent and Berlin.That’s just one example of how technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains.Fintech start-up Lendingkart Technologies has developed tools based on big data analytics to help lenders evaluate borrowers’ creditworthiness. Using these tools, its sister company Lendingkart Finance Ltd aims to transform small business lending by providing easy access to credit for small and medium enterprises.The “technology platform has helped create a highly operational efficiency model that enables swift loan disbursement within 72 hours of loan application. Over 120,000 SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) have till date reached out to Lendingkart Finance for their credit needs,” the company said.Accenture Labs and Akshaya Patra, the world’s largest NGO-run midday meal programme, said on Thursday that they had partnered in a project to “exponentially increase the number of meals served to children in schools in India that are run and aided by the government”.Using “disruptive technology”, they hope to potentially “improve efficiency by 20%, which could boost the number of meals served by millions”.Accenture Labs began the project with a “strategic assessment and design thinking, then developed a prototype for improving kitchen operations and outcomes”. An example of Akshaya Patra’s transformation, according to Thursday’s statement, was its move “from manual collection of feedback from children and schools to a more efficient technology-based solution” that involved the use of blockchain (the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin) and sensor-enabled devices to gather feedback digitally, and use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to “predict the next day’s meal requirements”. Consider another example. Until even early 2015, the thousands of distributors of consumer goods firm Marico Ltd in Mumbai used to place orders and wait “almost a day” before getting the goods delivered. Now it takes just 10-15 minutes for an order to be delivered, helping them stock fewer goods. In turn, the lower inventory helps them cut down on warehouse space and pare costs, besides reducing the waiting time for trucks. All these distributors have benefited from <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/PkjAud0lcXFc2H9egy0JQP/Marico-taps-analytics-for-growth.html"" target=""_blank"">an analytics-driven Order Management Execution System that the company launched in December 2014</a>.Big Data and the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) are intimately connected: billions of Internet-connected “things” will, by definition, generate massive amounts of data. By 2020, the world would have generated around 40 zettabytes of data, or 5,127 gigabytes per individual, according to an estimate by research firm International Data Corp. It’s no wonder that in 2006, market researcher Clive Humby declared data to be “the new oil”. Companies are sharpening their focus on analysing this deluge of data to understand consumer behaviour patterns. A report by software body Nasscom and Blueocean Market Intelligence, a global analytics and insight provider, predicts that the Indian analytics market will cross the $2 billion mark by this fiscal year.Companies are using Big Data analytics for everything—driving growth, reducing costs, improving operations and recruiting better people.A major portion of orders of e-commerce firms now come through their analytics-driven systems. These firms record the purchasing behaviour of buyers and customize things for them. Travel firms, on their part, use data analytics to understand their customers—from basic things like their travel patterns, the kind of hotels they like to stay in, who their typical co-travellers are, their experiences—all geared to giving the customer a personalized experience the next time the customer visits the website.In hospitals, intelligence derived from data helps improve patient care through quicker and more accurate diagnoses, drug dosage recommendations and the prediction of potential side effects. Millions of electronic medical records, public health data and claims records are being analysed.Predictive healthcare using wearables to check vital medical signs and remote diagnostics could cut patient waiting times, according to a 13 January report by the McKinsey Global Institute. International Business Machines Corp.’s Watson, a cluster of computers that combines artificial intelligence and advanced analytics software and works as a “question answering” system, is being used for a variety of applications, most notably in oncology, the branch of medicine that deals with cancer. Watson for Oncology helps physicians quickly identify key information in a patient’s medical records, sift through tons of data and come up with most optimal medical choices.Many companies globally and in India, including some start-ups, are using machine-learning tools to infuse intelligence in their business by using predictive models. Popular machine-learning applications include Google’s self-driving car, online recommendations from e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Flipkart, online dating service Tinder and streaming video platform Netflix. Railigent, Siemens AG’s platform for the predictive maintenance for trains, listens to the trains running over its sensors and can detect, from the sound of the wheels, which wheel is broken and when it should be replaced.Predictive algorithms are used in recruitment too. Aspiring Minds, for instance, uses algorithms powered by machine learning that draw on data to address complex issues—for instance, to accurately gauge the quality of speech in various accents against a neutral accent (also using natural language processing). This helps companies improve recruitment efficiency by over 35% and reduce voice evaluation costs by 55%.Artificial intelligence, machine-learning-based algorithms and anomaly-detection techniques will need to be used to monitor activity across networks and real-time data streams, consulting firms point out. These technologies will, for instance, let banks in India identify threats as they occur while maintaining low false positive alarm rates even for new types of threats.There are still challenges in bringing about wider technology adoption.“Our survey showed that only about 4% of companies across industries have the capabilities to use advanced data analytics to deliver tangible business value. While some oil and gas companies have invested in their analytics capabilities, many struggle to get their arms around this powerful new opportunity,” said a March 2014 note by Bain and Co..“We often find that senior executives understand the concepts around Big Data and advanced analytics, but their teams have difficulty defining the path to value creation and the implications for technology strategy, operating model and organization. Too often, companies delegate the task of capturing value from better analytics to the IT department, as a technology project,” the note pointed out.In the 2006 movie <i>Deja Vu</i>, law enforcement agents investigate an explosion on a ferry that kills over 500 people, including a large group of party-going sailors. They use a new program that uses satellite technology to look back in time for four-and-a-half days—to try to capture the terrorist.Predictive policing is surely not as advanced today. And advances in predictive analytics can certainly raise ethical issues. For instance, the police may in the future be able to predict who might become a serial offender, and make an intervention at an early stage to change the path followed by the person, as is the case in <i>Deja Vu</i>. Or an insurance firm may use predictions to increase the premium or even deny a user an insurance.Any disruptive technology needs checks and balances in the form of good policy if it is to deliver to its potential.",2017-05-02,"Technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains",competitor,22:20,Making predictions with Big Data

Until even early 2015, the thousands of distributors of consumer goods firm Marico Ltd in Mumbai used to place orders and wait “almost a day” before getting the goods delivered. Now it takes just 10-15 minutes for an order to be delivered, helping them stock fewer goods. In turn, the lower inventory helps them cut down on warehouse space and pare costs, besides reducing the waiting time for trucks. All these distributors have benefited from <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/PkjAud0lcXFc2H9egy0JQP/Marico-taps-analytics-for-growth.html"" target=""_blank"">an analytics-driven Order Management Execution System that the company launched in December 2014</a>.Big Data and the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) are intimately connected: billions of Internet-connected “things” will, by definition, generate massive amounts of data. By 2020, the world would have generated around 40 zettabytes of data, or 5,127 gigabytes per individual, according to an estimate by research firm International Data Corp.

-0.13,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"">Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd, despite a relatively good performance over the past two years, is battling perceptions of under-performance because of its inability to keep pace with its ambitious target of more than doubling its revenue to $20 billion by March 2021.This target appears to have done more harm than good: analysts continue to rate the company using it as a metric; and people in the know attribute the departure of at least a few senior executives over the past few years to it. Now, an analyst at a foreign brokerage has suggested that the company is better off without the target.ALSO READ: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Money/JbzPzyPMJdV4ZBhqSyxkbK/Has-Infosyss-recovery-dissipated-before-it-even-started.html"" target=""_blank"">Has Infosys’s recovery dissipated before it even started?</a>“Management continues to maintain ‘aspirational’ revenue and margin targets that are increasingly becoming unlikely to be achieved, in our opinion. Given Infy (Infosys) is now guiding to lower levels of both revenue growth and margins in FY18 (2017-18), we think management would be well-served to either amend or drop its aspirational targets,” Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 April. Based on its <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/hI2j9yckPHHX6PkEuKU2PK/Infosys-Q4-earnings-subdued-guidance-lower-for-201718.html"" target=""_blank"">guidance for 2017-18</a>, issued last week, Infosys expects to end the year with revenue of between $10.8 billion and $11.3 billion. Infosys maintains this target is an ambition and the management has no plans to dump it.In April 2015, Infosys first outlined its ambitious target: India’s second largest software firm wanted to become a $20 billion firm with 30% operating margin and to generate $80,000 in revenue from every employee working on a project.  In 2016, it tweaked the deadline to 2020-21. Infosys ended financial year 2015 with $8.7 billion in revenue, 25.9% in operating margin and generated $52,300 per employee.Two years later, Infosys managed a compound annual growth rate of 8.25% to increase its revenue to $10.21 billion but operating margin declined by 120 basis points to 24.7% and revenue per employee slipped to $51,400, making many question CEO Vishal Sikka’s strategy.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Not that Sikka hasn’t delivered. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17;  for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been  the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the “impossible targets.” “The industry is going through a structural change, and to make it worse, you set yourself impossible targets,” said a former EVP, who quit last year. “A large component of a senior executive’s salary is tied to company’s annual growth, which itself is linked to the long-term target.”Infosys says it outlined a target to make its employees work towards a goal and eventually help script a turnaround.“We gave this target because we believed this would help motivate employees, and help the CEO make them work towards a goal,” one board member, who was part of the goal-setting exercise, said on  condition of anonymity. “Looking back, I’m still not sure if it was a wrong step. I’m still on the fence,  thinking how and what we could have done better to make sure hopes did not run high and employees did not come under pressure.”One of the things Infosys could have avoided was linking Sikka’s salary to the target, said the second executive who quit, a former SVP. This seemed to suggest that  this was much more than an aspirational target, as the CEO himself has repeatedly said. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/nZzaphFLFUOqP1EuegR9EL/Infosys-CEO-Vishal-Sikka-takes-home-only-61-of-eligible-pay.html"" target=""_blank"">A weak performance in this year hurt Sikka</a>, who earned $6.8 million in 2016-17, less than the $7.3 million he earned in 2015-16. Sikka got $3.8 million of the promised $8 million performance-related pay, despite a clause in his employment contract that guaranteed him at least 90% of his $11 million salary (including bonuses). It is a general practice for companies to have long-term goals. Wipro, under Abidali Neemuchwala, has outlined an ambition to become $15 billion firm with a 23% margin by March 2020. India’s fifth largest software firm, Tech Mahindra Ltd, too has set a goal of more than doubling revenue to $10 billion by March 2020.",2017-04-21,"Vishal Sikka’s ambitious revenue target, which Infosys is struggling to keep pace with, seems to have done more harm than good",competitor,02:43,Infosys weighed down by $20 billion revenue target set by Vishal Sikka

Watson for Oncology helps physicians quickly identify key information in a patient’s medical records, sift through tons of data and come up with most optimal medical choices.Many companies globally and in India, including some start-ups, are using machine-learning tools to infuse intelligence in their business by using predictive models. Popular machine-learning applications include Google’s self-driving car, online recommendations from e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Flipkart, online dating service Tinder and streaming video platform Netflix. Railigent, Siemens AG’s platform for the predictive maintenance for trains, listens to the trains running over its sensors and can detect, from the sound of the wheels, which wheel is broken and when it should be replaced.Predictive algorithms are used in recruitment too. Aspiring Minds, for instance, uses algorithms powered by machine learning that draw on data to address complex issues—for instance, to accurately gauge the quality of speech in various accents against a neutral accent (also using natural language processing). This helps companies improve recruitment efficiency by over 35% and reduce voice evaluation costs by 55%.Artificial intelligence, machine-learning-based algorithms and anomaly-detection techniques will need to be used to monitor activity across networks and real-time data streams, consulting firms point out. These technologies will, for instance, let banks in India identify threats as they occur while maintaining low false positive alarm rates even for new types of threats.There are still challenges in bringing about wider technology adoption.“Our survey showed that only about 4% of companies across industries have the capabilities to use advanced data analytics to deliver tangible business value. While some oil and gas companies have invested in their analytics capabilities, many struggle to get their arms around this powerful new opportunity,” said a March 2014 note by Bain and Co..“We often find that senior executives understand the concepts around Big Data and advanced analytics, but their teams have difficulty defining the path to value creation and the implications for technology strategy, operating model and organization. Too often, companies delegate the task of capturing value from better analytics to the IT department, as a technology project,” the note pointed out.In the 2006 movie <i>Deja Vu</i>, law enforcement agents investigate an explosion on a ferry that kills over 500 people, including a large group of party-going sailors. They use a new program that uses satellite technology to look back in time for four-and-a-half days—to try to capture the terrorist.Predictive policing is surely not as advanced today. And advances in predictive analytics can certainly raise ethical issues. For instance, the police may in the future be able to predict who might become a serial offender, and make an intervention at an early stage to change the path followed by the person, as is the case in <i>Deja Vu</i>. Or an insurance firm may use predictions to increase the premium or even deny a user an insurance.Any disruptive technology needs checks and balances in the form of good policy if it is to deliver to its potential.",2017-05-02,"Technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains",competitor,22:20,Making predictions with Big Data

Now, an analyst at a foreign brokerage has suggested that the company is better off without the target.ALSO READ: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Money/JbzPzyPMJdV4ZBhqSyxkbK/Has-Infosyss-recovery-dissipated-before-it-even-started.html"" target=""_blank"">Has Infosys’s recovery dissipated before it even started?</a>“Management continues to maintain ‘aspirational’ revenue and margin targets that are increasingly becoming unlikely to be achieved, in our opinion. Given Infy (Infosys) is now guiding to lower levels of both revenue growth and margins in FY18 (2017-18), we think management would be well-served to either amend or drop its aspirational targets,” Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 April. Based on its <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/hI2j9yckPHHX6PkEuKU2PK/Infosys-Q4-earnings-subdued-guidance-lower-for-201718.html"" target=""_blank"">guidance for 2017-18</a>, issued last week, Infosys expects to end the year with revenue of between $10.8 billion and $11.3 billion. Infosys maintains this target is an ambition and the management has no plans to dump it.In April 2015, Infosys first outlined its ambitious target: India’s second largest software firm wanted to become a $20 billion firm with 30% operating margin and to generate $80,000 in revenue from every employee working on a project.  In 2016, it tweaked the deadline to 2020-21. Infosys ended financial year 2015 with $8.7 billion in revenue, 25.9% in operating margin and generated $52,300 per employee.Two years later, Infosys managed a compound annual growth rate of 8.25% to increase its revenue to $10.21 billion but operating margin declined by 120 basis points to 24.7% and revenue per employee slipped to $51,400, making many question CEO Vishal Sikka’s strategy.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Not that Sikka hasn’t delivered. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17;  for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been  the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the “impossible targets.” “The industry is going through a structural change, and to make it worse, you set yourself impossible targets,” said a former EVP, who quit last year. “A large component of a senior executive’s salary is tied to company’s annual growth, which itself is linked to the long-term target.”Infosys says it outlined a target to make its employees work towards a goal and eventually help script a turnaround.“We gave this target because we believed this would help motivate employees, and help the CEO make them work towards a goal,” one board member, who was part of the goal-setting exercise, said on  condition of anonymity. “Looking back, I’m still not sure if it was a wrong step. I’m still on the fence,  thinking how and what we could have done better to make sure hopes did not run high and employees did not come under pressure.”One of the things Infosys could have avoided was linking Sikka’s salary to the target, said the second executive who quit, a former SVP. This seemed to suggest that  this was much more than an aspirational target, as the CEO himself has repeatedly said. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/nZzaphFLFUOqP1EuegR9EL/Infosys-CEO-Vishal-Sikka-takes-home-only-61-of-eligible-pay.html"" target=""_blank"">A weak performance in this year hurt Sikka</a>, who earned $6.8 million in 2016-17, less than the $7.3 million he earned in 2015-16. Sikka got $3.8 million of the promised $8 million performance-related pay, despite a clause in his employment contract that guaranteed him at least 90% of his $11 million salary (including bonuses). It is a general practice for companies to have long-term goals. Wipro, under Abidali Neemuchwala, has outlined an ambition to become $15 billion firm with a 23% margin by March 2020.

The firms bidding included companies from the Middle East and other locations new to India’s renewables auctions.Infrastructure development and finance group IL&amp;FS has developed the 500-megawatt solar park by acquiring land for installations and building power evacuation systems, while the same has been done for the remaining 250-megawatt portion by Indian conglomerate Adani group.The solar park charges for the IL&amp;FS group facility are Rs0.42 crore a megawatt, while that for the Adani group’s park are Rs0.36 crore, SECI General Manager Sanjay Sharma said.

-0.61,"Mumbai: For Grishma, an Indian software designer, President Donald Trump’s review of the visa programme for bringing highly skilled workers into the United States comes at a bad time.Fresh from gaining a master’s degree in Europe, and with an offer of employment from a well-known US design firm, she was well on her way to fulfilling the ambition of many young Indian IT workers—a dream job in America.But as she waits in the H1B visa queue for the green light, she is caught in a bind. “It’s a weird time to be applying, with all the scrutiny,” said Grishma, who gave only her first name for fear of jeopardising her chances of getting a visa.The United States has already suspended the “expedited processing option” for applicants, under which she may have received a visa in weeks. More broadly, uncertainty over the review announced this week has unsettled Grishma and many others like her.She will have to wait until at least around August to learn her fate, but having accepted the US job offer she is not in a position to apply for positions elsewhere, including in Europe. “It’s pretty debilitating,” Grishma told <i>Reuters</i>. “I’d like to start work to mitigate the financial damage.”Trump’s decision was not a huge surprise, given his election campaign pledge to put American jobs first.Also read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Politics/4ItpsVUuXrtimX2wLZXlnL/H1B-visa-curbs-India-threatens-US-with-trade-retaliation.html"">H-1B visa curbs—India talks tough, signals it may hit back at US</a>But the executive order he signed, though vague in many areas, has prompted thousands of foreign workers already in the United States or applying for visas to work there to re-think their plans. Companies who send them also face huge uncertainty.The concerns are particularly acute in India, where IT firms like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd are top beneficiaries of the H1B visa programme, using it to send computer engineers to service clients in the United States, their largest overseas market.Companies and staff realignExperts say Trump’s order to review visa processes is aimed at firms like TCS, Infosys and Wipro, which from 2005-14 snagged around 86,000 H1B visas, roughly equivalent to the number of H1B visas the United States issues in total each year.Two industry people aware of the matter said Infosys, India’s no. 2 information technology (IT) services company, is applying for just under 1,000 H1B visas this year, which one of the people said was down from 6,500 applications in 2016 and some 9,000 in 2015.It was not clear whether the sharp reduction in 2017 was in direct response to Trump’s presidency, although the company has said for some time it wanted to cut dependence on “fly-in” staff. TCS, Infosys and Wipro said they would not share data on the number of H1B visas they had applied for this year.With fewer visas going to Infosys, more might become available for smaller IT companies and big US tech companies, like Facebook and Microsoft Corp, that typically send in fewer H1B applications each year.US-based immigration lawyer Murali Bashyam, managing partner of Bashyam Spiro LLP which advises and works with small to mid-sized Indian IT firms, said clients had been in contact seeking clarity, while the number of visa applicants had fallen.“I think the reason for that is they get the sense that it’s going to get so much tougher to comply with all of the changes ... that it might not be worth their money,” he said. “There is a fear that radical immigration changes are coming, and if those radical immigration changes come then it could completely change the way IT staffing companies do business.”Bashyam said the number of people on H1B visas already working in the United States who were considering returning to their home country had risen.An engineer working at Cisco, who has been in the United States since 2011, said that three months ago he would not have considered returning to India. But the review of the visa system, and any rule change that revoked the right for his wife to work in the United States on a dependent visa, could force him to change his mind.“If that happens, then I would definitely be interested in going back to India. Even though I’m secure, I don’t want to be in a situation where my wife cannot work,” said the engineer, who declined to be named. “Those who have heavily invested here, who’ve bought houses, property and are still on visas, are afraid.”‘I’m looking eastward’According to Bashyam, some Indians on H1B visas were cancelling plans to return home to visit their families in case they had problems getting back into the United States. “With everything that’s going on, travelling outside the US is the biggest fear for a lot of the H1B workers working in the IT staffing industry,” he said.And the uncertainty is not limited to IT. Trump’s campaign rhetoric around tighter visa rules has led some Indian students considering studying abroad to look beyond the United States, which typically draws in over 1,00,000 Indian students annually.One Canadian official said the number of student visa applications for certain courses in Canada had spiked over 250% since Trump’s election win in November.Akshay Baliga, a management consultant with a H1B visa that is valid until 2018, said he was not considering returning to the United States for work any time soon. “As a professional I’m looking eastward,” said Baliga, now based in India but who earlier studied and lived for years in America.

Now, an analyst at a foreign brokerage has suggested that the company is better off without the target.ALSO READ: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Money/JbzPzyPMJdV4ZBhqSyxkbK/Has-Infosyss-recovery-dissipated-before-it-even-started.html"" target=""_blank"">Has Infosys’s recovery dissipated before it even started?</a>“Management continues to maintain ‘aspirational’ revenue and margin targets that are increasingly becoming unlikely to be achieved, in our opinion. Given Infy (Infosys) is now guiding to lower levels of both revenue growth and margins in FY18 (2017-18), we think management would be well-served to either amend or drop its aspirational targets,” Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 April. Based on its <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/hI2j9yckPHHX6PkEuKU2PK/Infosys-Q4-earnings-subdued-guidance-lower-for-201718.html"" target=""_blank"">guidance for 2017-18</a>, issued last week, Infosys expects to end the year with revenue of between $10.8 billion and $11.3 billion. Infosys maintains this target is an ambition and the management has no plans to dump it.In April 2015, Infosys first outlined its ambitious target: India’s second largest software firm wanted to become a $20 billion firm with 30% operating margin and to generate $80,000 in revenue from every employee working on a project.  In 2016, it tweaked the deadline to 2020-21. Infosys ended financial year 2015 with $8.7 billion in revenue, 25.9% in operating margin and generated $52,300 per employee.Two years later, Infosys managed a compound annual growth rate of 8.25% to increase its revenue to $10.21 billion but operating margin declined by 120 basis points to 24.7% and revenue per employee slipped to $51,400, making many question CEO Vishal Sikka’s strategy.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Not that Sikka hasn’t delivered. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17;  for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been  the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the “impossible targets.” “The industry is going through a structural change, and to make it worse, you set yourself impossible targets,” said a former EVP, who quit last year. “A large component of a senior executive’s salary is tied to company’s annual growth, which itself is linked to the long-term target.”Infosys says it outlined a target to make its employees work towards a goal and eventually help script a turnaround.“We gave this target because we believed this would help motivate employees, and help the CEO make them work towards a goal,” one board member, who was part of the goal-setting exercise, said on  condition of anonymity. “Looking back, I’m still not sure if it was a wrong step. I’m still on the fence,  thinking how and what we could have done better to make sure hopes did not run high and employees did not come under pressure.”One of the things Infosys could have avoided was linking Sikka’s salary to the target, said the second executive who quit, a former SVP. This seemed to suggest that  this was much more than an aspirational target, as the CEO himself has repeatedly said. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/nZzaphFLFUOqP1EuegR9EL/Infosys-CEO-Vishal-Sikka-takes-home-only-61-of-eligible-pay.html"" target=""_blank"">A weak performance in this year hurt Sikka</a>, who earned $6.8 million in 2016-17, less than the $7.3 million he earned in 2015-16.

-0.25,"New Delhi: The ministry of electronics and IT on Thursday issued guidelines on setting up of IT infrastructure by government departments using cloud computing technology with a clause mandating that all data must be stored within the country. The guidelines for government departments on contractual terms related to cloud services said since the data can be located in one or more discrete sites in foreign countries, therefore, the condition for data location has to be specifically mentioned in the agreement with the service provider. “The terms and conditions of the Empanelment of the Cloud Service Provider has taken care of this requirement by stating that all services including data will be guaranteed to reside in India,” the guidelines said. The cloud computing service enables its user to hire or use software, storage, servers as per requirement instead of purchasing the whole system. Meity has empanelled 11 companies for providing cloud computing services to government departments which include Microsoft Corp., Hewlett Packard, IBM India ,Tata Communications, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), Net Magic IT Services, Sify Technologies and CtrlS Data Centers. Cloud computing can help government departments expand capacity of their IT system as per need and even for short period and quickly start any online service. The cloud computing system can be of help to departments specially in handling sudden load of web traffic generated to access their websites like in case of train ticket booking, form filling or tax submission on a last date etc. “...the department is required to move away from the traditional fixed payment model to a variable pricing / utility pricing model where the department pays for the resources it actually uses during that period. The payment terms have to be structured accordingly to pay only for the resources used by the department,” a separate set of guideline issued for cloud services procurement said. The guidelines on cloud computing follows MeghRaj Policy (cloud policy) to provide strategic direction for adoption of cloud services by the government. The aim of the cloud policy is to realise a comprehensive vision of a government cloud (GI Cloud) environment available for use by central and state government line departments, districts and municipalities to accelerate their ICT-enabled service improvements. As per the guidelines, both cloud service provider (CSP) and government department will have to share responsibility for the managing services provisioned using cloud computing facility.“The CSP’s part in this shared responsibility includes providing its services on a highly secure and controlled platform and providing a wide array of security features customers can use. The departments’ responsibility includes configuring their IT environments in a secure and controlled manner for their purposes,” the guideline said.",2017-04-20,"Meity has empanelled 11 companies for providing cloud computing services to government departments which include Microsoft , IBM India  and  BSNL",competitor,23:13,Govt IT data on cloud system must be stored within India: Meity
-0.35,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"">At first glance, the letter from the Delhi police commissioner’s desk could have easily been dismissed as  another routine laundry list of his department’s “achievements” in the previous year.A closer look at the letter, written a little over two years ago, would have sprung a pleasant surprise in the context of the city police’s technology prowess.The Delhi Police, according to the letter, had partnered with the Indian Space Research Organisation to implement CMAPS—Crime Mapping, Analytics and Predictive System—under the “Effective use of Space Technology-based Tools for Internal Security Scheme” initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014.CMAPS generates crime-reporting queries and has the capacity to identify crime hotspots by auto sweep on the Dial 100 database every 1-3 minutes, replacing a Delhi Police crime-mapping tool that involved manual gathering of data every 15 days. It performs trend analysis, compiles crime and criminal profiles and analyses the behaviour of suspected offenders—all with accompanying graphics. CMAPs also has a security module for VIP threat rating, based on vulnerability of the potential target and the security deployed, and advanced predictive analysis, among other features.A prototype of the standalone version was installed at the Delhi Police control room in June 2015. The software’s statistical models and algorithms today help the police carry out “predictive policing” to forecast where the next crime is likely to occur, much like in cities such as London, Los Angeles, Kent and Berlin.That’s just one example of how technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains.Fintech start-up Lendingkart Technologies has developed tools based on big data analytics to help lenders evaluate borrowers’ creditworthiness. Using these tools, its sister company Lendingkart Finance Ltd aims to transform small business lending by providing easy access to credit for small and medium enterprises.The “technology platform has helped create a highly operational efficiency model that enables swift loan disbursement within 72 hours of loan application. Over 120,000 SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) have till date reached out to Lendingkart Finance for their credit needs,” the company said.Accenture Labs and Akshaya Patra, the world’s largest NGO-run midday meal programme, said on Thursday that they had partnered in a project to “exponentially increase the number of meals served to children in schools in India that are run and aided by the government”.Using “disruptive technology”, they hope to potentially “improve efficiency by 20%, which could boost the number of meals served by millions”.Accenture Labs began the project with a “strategic assessment and design thinking, then developed a prototype for improving kitchen operations and outcomes”. An example of Akshaya Patra’s transformation, according to Thursday’s statement, was its move “from manual collection of feedback from children and schools to a more efficient technology-based solution” that involved the use of blockchain (the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin) and sensor-enabled devices to gather feedback digitally, and use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to “predict the next day’s meal requirements”. Consider another example. Until even early 2015, the thousands of distributors of consumer goods firm Marico Ltd in Mumbai used to place orders and wait “almost a day” before getting the goods delivered. Now it takes just 10-15 minutes for an order to be delivered, helping them stock fewer goods. In turn, the lower inventory helps them cut down on warehouse space and pare costs, besides reducing the waiting time for trucks. All these distributors have benefited from <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/PkjAud0lcXFc2H9egy0JQP/Marico-taps-analytics-for-growth.html"" target=""_blank"">an analytics-driven Order Management Execution System that the company launched in December 2014</a>.Big Data and the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) are intimately connected: billions of Internet-connected “things” will, by definition, generate massive amounts of data. By 2020, the world would have generated around 40 zettabytes of data, or 5,127 gigabytes per individual, according to an estimate by research firm International Data Corp. It’s no wonder that in 2006, market researcher Clive Humby declared data to be “the new oil”. Companies are sharpening their focus on analysing this deluge of data to understand consumer behaviour patterns. A report by software body Nasscom and Blueocean Market Intelligence, a global analytics and insight provider, predicts that the Indian analytics market will cross the $2 billion mark by this fiscal year.Companies are using Big Data analytics for everything—driving growth, reducing costs, improving operations and recruiting better people.A major portion of orders of e-commerce firms now come through their analytics-driven systems. These firms record the purchasing behaviour of buyers and customize things for them. Travel firms, on their part, use data analytics to understand their customers—from basic things like their travel patterns, the kind of hotels they like to stay in, who their typical co-travellers are, their experiences—all geared to giving the customer a personalized experience the next time the customer visits the website.In hospitals, intelligence derived from data helps improve patient care through quicker and more accurate diagnoses, drug dosage recommendations and the prediction of potential side effects. Millions of electronic medical records, public health data and claims records are being analysed.Predictive healthcare using wearables to check vital medical signs and remote diagnostics could cut patient waiting times, according to a 13 January report by the McKinsey Global Institute. International Business Machines Corp.’s Watson, a cluster of computers that combines artificial intelligence and advanced analytics software and works as a “question answering” system, is being used for a variety of applications, most notably in oncology, the branch of medicine that deals with cancer. Watson for Oncology helps physicians quickly identify key information in a patient’s medical records, sift through tons of data and come up with most optimal medical choices.Many companies globally and in India, including some start-ups, are using machine-learning tools to infuse intelligence in their business by using predictive models. Popular machine-learning applications include Google’s self-driving car, online recommendations from e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Flipkart, online dating service Tinder and streaming video platform Netflix. Railigent, Siemens AG’s platform for the predictive maintenance for trains, listens to the trains running over its sensors and can detect, from the sound of the wheels, which wheel is broken and when it should be replaced.Predictive algorithms are used in recruitment too. Aspiring Minds, for instance, uses algorithms powered by machine learning that draw on data to address complex issues—for instance, to accurately gauge the quality of speech in various accents against a neutral accent (also using natural language processing). This helps companies improve recruitment efficiency by over 35% and reduce voice evaluation costs by 55%.Artificial intelligence, machine-learning-based algorithms and anomaly-detection techniques will need to be used to monitor activity across networks and real-time data streams, consulting firms point out. These technologies will, for instance, let banks in India identify threats as they occur while maintaining low false positive alarm rates even for new types of threats.There are still challenges in bringing about wider technology adoption.“Our survey showed that only about 4% of companies across industries have the capabilities to use advanced data analytics to deliver tangible business value. While some oil and gas companies have invested in their analytics capabilities, many struggle to get their arms around this powerful new opportunity,” said a March 2014 note by Bain and Co..“We often find that senior executives understand the concepts around Big Data and advanced analytics, but their teams have difficulty defining the path to value creation and the implications for technology strategy, operating model and organization. Too often, companies delegate the task of capturing value from better analytics to the IT department, as a technology project,” the note pointed out.In the 2006 movie <i>Deja Vu</i>, law enforcement agents investigate an explosion on a ferry that kills over 500 people, including a large group of party-going sailors. They use a new program that uses satellite technology to look back in time for four-and-a-half days—to try to capture the terrorist.Predictive policing is surely not as advanced today. And advances in predictive analytics can certainly raise ethical issues. For instance, the police may in the future be able to predict who might become a serial offender, and make an intervention at an early stage to change the path followed by the person, as is the case in <i>Deja Vu</i>. Or an insurance firm may use predictions to increase the premium or even deny a user an insurance.Any disruptive technology needs checks and balances in the form of good policy if it is to deliver to its potential.",2017-05-02,"Technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains",competitor,22:20,Making predictions with Big Data

Cyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltd moved the NCLAT on Wednesday against the 6 March order by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that the petition was non-maintainable, said two people aware of the development who requested anonymity.The office of Mistry, who was ousted as Tata Sons chairman on 24 October, declined to comment. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/1IO7g0PBh6Z4S0D52hQuUP/NCLT-says-Mistry-family-firms-petition-not-maintainable.html"" target=""_blank"">NCLT had ruled that Cyrus Investments and Sterling Investments were not qualified to file the petition</a> alleging mismanagement and oppression of minority shareholders at Tata Sons, the holding company of the $103 billion Tata group.“The petitioners have failed to convince the court that the application is maintainable,” said B.S.V. Kumar, presiding member of NCLT, in the March order. Under the new Companies Act, shareholders are required to hold 10% equity to be qualified to file such a petition. The Act does not define equity to mean only ordinary equity.The two Mistry firms own a combined 18.4% of ordinary equity shares of the Tata group holding firm, but their holding falls below 10% when preference shares are taken into account. According to the Tatas, Mistry firms hold only about 2.17% then.Later, in an order passed on 17 April, NCLT said it would not waive the 10% requirement for the Mistry firms to file the petition. It makes sense for Mistry’s firms to approach the appellate body on maintainability and waiver separately as the legal arguments put forward on the two issues were different, said Ramesh Vaidyanathan, founder and managing partner at Advaya Legal, a law firm.The plea on maintainability was based on the fact that equity shareholding of the Mistry firms is above the threshold of 10%. The waiver arguments were on why the tribunal should waive the threshold requirement, said Vaidyanathan. While arguing in favour of the waiver, the Mistry firms had cited concerns on voting and veto rights accorded to Tata trustees on the board of Tata Sons.“Assuming that the petitioners are likely to approach the tribunal on waiver and main petition being dismissed, the tribunal may consider merging the appeal against dismissal of maintainability and waiver. This is because the urgency to deal with this matter is no longer there,” added Vaidyanathan. As the final order of the 17 April hearing is yet to be released, the firms could not have clubbed the waiver and maintainability petitions, said the first of the two people cited earlier. In a setback to Mistry and his family firms, the NCLT in its 17 April hearing not only refused to grant a waiver from the shareholding requirement, but also <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/6FpejrVtvJSI0rjb5SC0vO/NCLT-dismisses-Cyrus-Mistry-petitions-against-Tata-Sons.html"" target=""_blank"">dismissed the main petition alleging mismanagement and oppression</a>.The appellate authority typically doesn’t interfere with a decision by the lower authority unless there’s been a gross injustice, said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner at law firm IC Legal. “They (Mistry camp) really will have to bring in something substantial to the appellate tribunal to override the ruling of the lower authority,” he said.

More broadly, uncertainty over the review announced this week has unsettled Grishma and many others like her.She will have to wait until at least around August to learn her fate, but having accepted the US job offer she is not in a position to apply for positions elsewhere, including in Europe. “It’s pretty debilitating,” Grishma told <i>Reuters</i>. “I’d like to start work to mitigate the financial damage.”Trump’s decision was not a huge surprise, given his election campaign pledge to put American jobs first.Also read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Politics/4ItpsVUuXrtimX2wLZXlnL/H1B-visa-curbs-India-threatens-US-with-trade-retaliation.html"">H-1B visa curbs—India talks tough, signals it may hit back at US</a>But the executive order he signed, though vague in many areas, has prompted thousands of foreign workers already in the United States or applying for visas to work there to re-think their plans. Companies who send them also face huge uncertainty.The concerns are particularly acute in India, where IT firms like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd are top beneficiaries of the H1B visa programme, using it to send computer engineers to service clients in the United States, their largest overseas market.Companies and staff realignExperts say Trump’s order to review visa processes is aimed at firms like TCS, Infosys and Wipro, which from 2005-14 snagged around 86,000 H1B visas, roughly equivalent to the number of H1B visas the United States issues in total each year.Two industry people aware of the matter said Infosys, India’s no. 2 information technology (IT) services company, is applying for just under 1,000 H1B visas this year, which one of the people said was down from 6,500 applications in 2016 and some 9,000 in 2015.It was not clear whether the sharp reduction in 2017 was in direct response to Trump’s presidency, although the company has said for some time it wanted to cut dependence on “fly-in” staff. TCS, Infosys and Wipro said they would not share data on the number of H1B visas they had applied for this year.With fewer visas going to Infosys, more might become available for smaller IT companies and big US tech companies, like Facebook and Microsoft Corp, that typically send in fewer H1B applications each year.US-based immigration lawyer Murali Bashyam, managing partner of Bashyam Spiro LLP which advises and works with small to mid-sized Indian IT firms, said clients had been in contact seeking clarity, while the number of visa applicants had fallen.“I think the reason for that is they get the sense that it’s going to get so much tougher to comply with all of the changes ... that it might not be worth their money,” he said. “There is a fear that radical immigration changes are coming, and if those radical immigration changes come then it could completely change the way IT staffing companies do business.”Bashyam said the number of people on H1B visas already working in the United States who were considering returning to their home country had risen.An engineer working at Cisco, who has been in the United States since 2011, said that three months ago he would not have considered returning to India. But the review of the visa system, and any rule change that revoked the right for his wife to work in the United States on a dependent visa, could force him to change his mind.“If that happens, then I would definitely be interested in going back to India. Even though I’m secure, I don’t want to be in a situation where my wife cannot work,” said the engineer, who declined to be named. “Those who have heavily invested here, who’ve bought houses, property and are still on visas, are afraid.”‘I’m looking eastward’According to Bashyam, some Indians on H1B visas were cancelling plans to return home to visit their families in case they had problems getting back into the United States. “With everything that’s going on, travelling outside the US is the biggest fear for a lot of the H1B workers working in the IT staffing industry,” he said.And the uncertainty is not limited to IT. Trump’s campaign rhetoric around tighter visa rules has led some Indian students considering studying abroad to look beyond the United States, which typically draws in over 1,00,000 Indian students annually.One Canadian official said the number of student visa applications for certain courses in Canada had spiked over 250% since Trump’s election win in November.Akshay Baliga, a management consultant with a H1B visa that is valid until 2018, said he was not considering returning to the United States for work any time soon. “As a professional I’m looking eastward,” said Baliga, now based in India but who earlier studied and lived for years in America.

-0.05,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"">Mumbai: Advancing the legal battle with Tata Sons Ltd, Cyrus Mistry’s investment firms have filed an appeal at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), challenging the rejection of their petition alleging mismanagement and oppression of minority shareholders. Cyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltd moved the NCLAT on Wednesday against the 6 March order by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that the petition was non-maintainable, said two people aware of the development who requested anonymity.The office of Mistry, who was ousted as Tata Sons chairman on 24 October, declined to comment. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/1IO7g0PBh6Z4S0D52hQuUP/NCLT-says-Mistry-family-firms-petition-not-maintainable.html"" target=""_blank"">NCLT had ruled that Cyrus Investments and Sterling Investments were not qualified to file the petition</a> alleging mismanagement and oppression of minority shareholders at Tata Sons, the holding company of the $103 billion Tata group.“The petitioners have failed to convince the court that the application is maintainable,” said B.S.V. Kumar, presiding member of NCLT, in the March order. Under the new Companies Act, shareholders are required to hold 10% equity to be qualified to file such a petition. The Act does not define equity to mean only ordinary equity.The two Mistry firms own a combined 18.4% of ordinary equity shares of the Tata group holding firm, but their holding falls below 10% when preference shares are taken into account. According to the Tatas, Mistry firms hold only about 2.17% then.Later, in an order passed on 17 April, NCLT said it would not waive the 10% requirement for the Mistry firms to file the petition. It makes sense for Mistry’s firms to approach the appellate body on maintainability and waiver separately as the legal arguments put forward on the two issues were different, said Ramesh Vaidyanathan, founder and managing partner at Advaya Legal, a law firm.The plea on maintainability was based on the fact that equity shareholding of the Mistry firms is above the threshold of 10%. The waiver arguments were on why the tribunal should waive the threshold requirement, said Vaidyanathan. While arguing in favour of the waiver, the Mistry firms had cited concerns on voting and veto rights accorded to Tata trustees on the board of Tata Sons.“Assuming that the petitioners are likely to approach the tribunal on waiver and main petition being dismissed, the tribunal may consider merging the appeal against dismissal of maintainability and waiver. This is because the urgency to deal with this matter is no longer there,” added Vaidyanathan. As the final order of the 17 April hearing is yet to be released, the firms could not have clubbed the waiver and maintainability petitions, said the first of the two people cited earlier. In a setback to Mistry and his family firms, the NCLT in its 17 April hearing not only refused to grant a waiver from the shareholding requirement, but also <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/6FpejrVtvJSI0rjb5SC0vO/NCLT-dismisses-Cyrus-Mistry-petitions-against-Tata-Sons.html"" target=""_blank"">dismissed the main petition alleging mismanagement and oppression</a>.The appellate authority typically doesn’t interfere with a decision by the lower authority unless there’s been a gross injustice, said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner at law firm IC Legal. “They (Mistry camp) really will have to bring in something substantial to the appellate tribunal to override the ruling of the lower authority,” he said.

-0.35,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"">At first glance, the letter from the Delhi police commissioner’s desk could have easily been dismissed as  another routine laundry list of his department’s “achievements” in the previous year.A closer look at the letter, written a little over two years ago, would have sprung a pleasant surprise in the context of the city police’s technology prowess.The Delhi Police, according to the letter, had partnered with the Indian Space Research Organisation to implement CMAPS—Crime Mapping, Analytics and Predictive System—under the “Effective use of Space Technology-based Tools for Internal Security Scheme” initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014.CMAPS generates crime-reporting queries and has the capacity to identify crime hotspots by auto sweep on the Dial 100 database every 1-3 minutes, replacing a Delhi Police crime-mapping tool that involved manual gathering of data every 15 days. It performs trend analysis, compiles crime and criminal profiles and analyses the behaviour of suspected offenders—all with accompanying graphics. CMAPs also has a security module for VIP threat rating, based on vulnerability of the potential target and the security deployed, and advanced predictive analysis, among other features.A prototype of the standalone version was installed at the Delhi Police control room in June 2015. The software’s statistical models and algorithms today help the police carry out “predictive policing” to forecast where the next crime is likely to occur, much like in cities such as London, Los Angeles, Kent and Berlin.That’s just one example of how technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains.Fintech start-up Lendingkart Technologies has developed tools based on big data analytics to help lenders evaluate borrowers’ creditworthiness. Using these tools, its sister company Lendingkart Finance Ltd aims to transform small business lending by providing easy access to credit for small and medium enterprises.The “technology platform has helped create a highly operational efficiency model that enables swift loan disbursement within 72 hours of loan application. Over 120,000 SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) have till date reached out to Lendingkart Finance for their credit needs,” the company said.Accenture Labs and Akshaya Patra, the world’s largest NGO-run midday meal programme, said on Thursday that they had partnered in a project to “exponentially increase the number of meals served to children in schools in India that are run and aided by the government”.Using “disruptive technology”, they hope to potentially “improve efficiency by 20%, which could boost the number of meals served by millions”.Accenture Labs began the project with a “strategic assessment and design thinking, then developed a prototype for improving kitchen operations and outcomes”. An example of Akshaya Patra’s transformation, according to Thursday’s statement, was its move “from manual collection of feedback from children and schools to a more efficient technology-based solution” that involved the use of blockchain (the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin) and sensor-enabled devices to gather feedback digitally, and use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to “predict the next day’s meal requirements”. Consider another example. Until even early 2015, the thousands of distributors of consumer goods firm Marico Ltd in Mumbai used to place orders and wait “almost a day” before getting the goods delivered. Now it takes just 10-15 minutes for an order to be delivered, helping them stock fewer goods. In turn, the lower inventory helps them cut down on warehouse space and pare costs, besides reducing the waiting time for trucks. All these distributors have benefited from <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/PkjAud0lcXFc2H9egy0JQP/Marico-taps-analytics-for-growth.html"" target=""_blank"">an analytics-driven Order Management Execution System that the company launched in December 2014</a>.Big Data and the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) are intimately connected: billions of Internet-connected “things” will, by definition, generate massive amounts of data. By 2020, the world would have generated around 40 zettabytes of data, or 5,127 gigabytes per individual, according to an estimate by research firm International Data Corp. It’s no wonder that in 2006, market researcher Clive Humby declared data to be “the new oil”. Companies are sharpening their focus on analysing this deluge of data to understand consumer behaviour patterns. A report by software body Nasscom and Blueocean Market Intelligence, a global analytics and insight provider, predicts that the Indian analytics market will cross the $2 billion mark by this fiscal year.Companies are using Big Data analytics for everything—driving growth, reducing costs, improving operations and recruiting better people.A major portion of orders of e-commerce firms now come through their analytics-driven systems. These firms record the purchasing behaviour of buyers and customize things for them. Travel firms, on their part, use data analytics to understand their customers—from basic things like their travel patterns, the kind of hotels they like to stay in, who their typical co-travellers are, their experiences—all geared to giving the customer a personalized experience the next time the customer visits the website.In hospitals, intelligence derived from data helps improve patient care through quicker and more accurate diagnoses, drug dosage recommendations and the prediction of potential side effects. Millions of electronic medical records, public health data and claims records are being analysed.Predictive healthcare using wearables to check vital medical signs and remote diagnostics could cut patient waiting times, according to a 13 January report by the McKinsey Global Institute. International Business Machines Corp.’s Watson, a cluster of computers that combines artificial intelligence and advanced analytics software and works as a “question answering” system, is being used for a variety of applications, most notably in oncology, the branch of medicine that deals with cancer. Watson for Oncology helps physicians quickly identify key information in a patient’s medical records, sift through tons of data and come up with most optimal medical choices.Many companies globally and in India, including some start-ups, are using machine-learning tools to infuse intelligence in their business by using predictive models. Popular machine-learning applications include Google’s self-driving car, online recommendations from e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Flipkart, online dating service Tinder and streaming video platform Netflix. Railigent, Siemens AG’s platform for the predictive maintenance for trains, listens to the trains running over its sensors and can detect, from the sound of the wheels, which wheel is broken and when it should be replaced.Predictive algorithms are used in recruitment too. Aspiring Minds, for instance, uses algorithms powered by machine learning that draw on data to address complex issues—for instance, to accurately gauge the quality of speech in various accents against a neutral accent (also using natural language processing). This helps companies improve recruitment efficiency by over 35% and reduce voice evaluation costs by 55%.Artificial intelligence, machine-learning-based algorithms and anomaly-detection techniques will need to be used to monitor activity across networks and real-time data streams, consulting firms point out. These technologies will, for instance, let banks in India identify threats as they occur while maintaining low false positive alarm rates even for new types of threats.There are still challenges in bringing about wider technology adoption.“Our survey showed that only about 4% of companies across industries have the capabilities to use advanced data analytics to deliver tangible business value. While some oil and gas companies have invested in their analytics capabilities, many struggle to get their arms around this powerful new opportunity,” said a March 2014 note by Bain and Co..“We often find that senior executives understand the concepts around Big Data and advanced analytics, but their teams have difficulty defining the path to value creation and the implications for technology strategy, operating model and organization. Too often, companies delegate the task of capturing value from better analytics to the IT department, as a technology project,” the note pointed out.In the 2006 movie <i>Deja Vu</i>, law enforcement agents investigate an explosion on a ferry that kills over 500 people, including a large group of party-going sailors. They use a new program that uses satellite technology to look back in time for four-and-a-half days—to try to capture the terrorist.Predictive policing is surely not as advanced today. And advances in predictive analytics can certainly raise ethical issues. For instance, the police may in the future be able to predict who might become a serial offender, and make an intervention at an early stage to change the path followed by the person, as is the case in <i>Deja Vu</i>. Or an insurance firm may use predictions to increase the premium or even deny a user an insurance.Any disruptive technology needs checks and balances in the form of good policy if it is to deliver to its potential.",2017-05-02,"Technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains",competitor,22:20,Making predictions with Big Data

Now, an analyst at a foreign brokerage has suggested that the company is better off without the target.ALSO READ: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Money/JbzPzyPMJdV4ZBhqSyxkbK/Has-Infosyss-recovery-dissipated-before-it-even-started.html"" target=""_blank"">Has Infosys’s recovery dissipated before it even started?</a>“Management continues to maintain ‘aspirational’ revenue and margin targets that are increasingly becoming unlikely to be achieved, in our opinion. Given Infy (Infosys) is now guiding to lower levels of both revenue growth and margins in FY18 (2017-18), we think management would be well-served to either amend or drop its aspirational targets,” Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 April. Based on its <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/hI2j9yckPHHX6PkEuKU2PK/Infosys-Q4-earnings-subdued-guidance-lower-for-201718.html"" target=""_blank"">guidance for 2017-18</a>, issued last week, Infosys expects to end the year with revenue of between $10.8 billion and $11.3 billion. Infosys maintains this target is an ambition and the management has no plans to dump it.In April 2015, Infosys first outlined its ambitious target: India’s second largest software firm wanted to become a $20 billion firm with 30% operating margin and to generate $80,000 in revenue from every employee working on a project.  In 2016, it tweaked the deadline to 2020-21. Infosys ended financial year 2015 with $8.7 billion in revenue, 25.9% in operating margin and generated $52,300 per employee.Two years later, Infosys managed a compound annual growth rate of 8.25% to increase its revenue to $10.21 billion but operating margin declined by 120 basis points to 24.7% and revenue per employee slipped to $51,400, making many question CEO Vishal Sikka’s strategy.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Not that Sikka hasn’t delivered. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17;  for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been  the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the “impossible targets.” “The industry is going through a structural change, and to make it worse, you set yourself impossible targets,” said a former EVP, who quit last year. “A large component of a senior executive’s salary is tied to company’s annual growth, which itself is linked to the long-term target.”Infosys says it outlined a target to make its employees work towards a goal and eventually help script a turnaround.“We gave this target because we believed this would help motivate employees, and help the CEO make them work towards a goal,” one board member, who was part of the goal-setting exercise, said on  condition of anonymity. “Looking back, I’m still not sure if it was a wrong step. I’m still on the fence,  thinking how and what we could have done better to make sure hopes did not run high and employees did not come under pressure.”One of the things Infosys could have avoided was linking Sikka’s salary to the target, said the second executive who quit, a former SVP. This seemed to suggest that  this was much more than an aspirational target, as the CEO himself has repeatedly said. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/nZzaphFLFUOqP1EuegR9EL/Infosys-CEO-Vishal-Sikka-takes-home-only-61-of-eligible-pay.html"" target=""_blank"">A weak performance in this year hurt Sikka</a>, who earned $6.8 million in 2016-17, less than the $7.3 million he earned in 2015-16.

-0.13,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"">Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd, despite a relatively good performance over the past two years, is battling perceptions of under-performance because of its inability to keep pace with its ambitious target of more than doubling its revenue to $20 billion by March 2021.This target appears to have done more harm than good: analysts continue to rate the company using it as a metric; and people in the know attribute the departure of at least a few senior executives over the past few years to it. Now, an analyst at a foreign brokerage has suggested that the company is better off without the target.ALSO READ: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Money/JbzPzyPMJdV4ZBhqSyxkbK/Has-Infosyss-recovery-dissipated-before-it-even-started.html"" target=""_blank"">Has Infosys’s recovery dissipated before it even started?</a>“Management continues to maintain ‘aspirational’ revenue and margin targets that are increasingly becoming unlikely to be achieved, in our opinion. Given Infy (Infosys) is now guiding to lower levels of both revenue growth and margins in FY18 (2017-18), we think management would be well-served to either amend or drop its aspirational targets,” Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 April. Based on its <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/hI2j9yckPHHX6PkEuKU2PK/Infosys-Q4-earnings-subdued-guidance-lower-for-201718.html"" target=""_blank"">guidance for 2017-18</a>, issued last week, Infosys expects to end the year with revenue of between $10.8 billion and $11.3 billion. Infosys maintains this target is an ambition and the management has no plans to dump it.In April 2015, Infosys first outlined its ambitious target: India’s second largest software firm wanted to become a $20 billion firm with 30% operating margin and to generate $80,000 in revenue from every employee working on a project.  In 2016, it tweaked the deadline to 2020-21. Infosys ended financial year 2015 with $8.7 billion in revenue, 25.9% in operating margin and generated $52,300 per employee.Two years later, Infosys managed a compound annual growth rate of 8.25% to increase its revenue to $10.21 billion but operating margin declined by 120 basis points to 24.7% and revenue per employee slipped to $51,400, making many question CEO Vishal Sikka’s strategy.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Not that Sikka hasn’t delivered. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17;  for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been  the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the “impossible targets.” “The industry is going through a structural change, and to make it worse, you set yourself impossible targets,” said a former EVP, who quit last year. “A large component of a senior executive’s salary is tied to company’s annual growth, which itself is linked to the long-term target.”Infosys says it outlined a target to make its employees work towards a goal and eventually help script a turnaround.“We gave this target because we believed this would help motivate employees, and help the CEO make them work towards a goal,” one board member, who was part of the goal-setting exercise, said on  condition of anonymity. “Looking back, I’m still not sure if it was a wrong step. I’m still on the fence,  thinking how and what we could have done better to make sure hopes did not run high and employees did not come under pressure.”One of the things Infosys could have avoided was linking Sikka’s salary to the target, said the second executive who quit, a former SVP. This seemed to suggest that  this was much more than an aspirational target, as the CEO himself has repeatedly said. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/nZzaphFLFUOqP1EuegR9EL/Infosys-CEO-Vishal-Sikka-takes-home-only-61-of-eligible-pay.html"" target=""_blank"">A weak performance in this year hurt Sikka</a>, who earned $6.8 million in 2016-17, less than the $7.3 million he earned in 2015-16.

-0.35,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"">At first glance, the letter from the Delhi police commissioner’s desk could have easily been dismissed as  another routine laundry list of his department’s “achievements” in the previous year.A closer look at the letter, written a little over two years ago, would have sprung a pleasant surprise in the context of the city police’s technology prowess.The Delhi Police, according to the letter, had partnered with the Indian Space Research Organisation to implement CMAPS—Crime Mapping, Analytics and Predictive System—under the “Effective use of Space Technology-based Tools for Internal Security Scheme” initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014.CMAPS generates crime-reporting queries and has the capacity to identify crime hotspots by auto sweep on the Dial 100 database every 1-3 minutes, replacing a Delhi Police crime-mapping tool that involved manual gathering of data every 15 days. It performs trend analysis, compiles crime and criminal profiles and analyses the behaviour of suspected offenders—all with accompanying graphics. CMAPs also has a security module for VIP threat rating, based on vulnerability of the potential target and the security deployed, and advanced predictive analysis, among other features.A prototype of the standalone version was installed at the Delhi Police control room in June 2015. The software’s statistical models and algorithms today help the police carry out “predictive policing” to forecast where the next crime is likely to occur, much like in cities such as London, Los Angeles, Kent and Berlin.That’s just one example of how technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains.Fintech start-up Lendingkart Technologies has developed tools based on big data analytics to help lenders evaluate borrowers’ creditworthiness. Using these tools, its sister company Lendingkart Finance Ltd aims to transform small business lending by providing easy access to credit for small and medium enterprises.The “technology platform has helped create a highly operational efficiency model that enables swift loan disbursement within 72 hours of loan application. Over 120,000 SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) have till date reached out to Lendingkart Finance for their credit needs,” the company said.Accenture Labs and Akshaya Patra, the world’s largest NGO-run midday meal programme, said on Thursday that they had partnered in a project to “exponentially increase the number of meals served to children in schools in India that are run and aided by the government”.Using “disruptive technology”, they hope to potentially “improve efficiency by 20%, which could boost the number of meals served by millions”.Accenture Labs began the project with a “strategic assessment and design thinking, then developed a prototype for improving kitchen operations and outcomes”. An example of Akshaya Patra’s transformation, according to Thursday’s statement, was its move “from manual collection of feedback from children and schools to a more efficient technology-based solution” that involved the use of blockchain (the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin) and sensor-enabled devices to gather feedback digitally, and use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to “predict the next day’s meal requirements”. Consider another example. Until even early 2015, the thousands of distributors of consumer goods firm Marico Ltd in Mumbai used to place orders and wait “almost a day” before getting the goods delivered. Now it takes just 10-15 minutes for an order to be delivered, helping them stock fewer goods. In turn, the lower inventory helps them cut down on warehouse space and pare costs, besides reducing the waiting time for trucks. All these distributors have benefited from <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/PkjAud0lcXFc2H9egy0JQP/Marico-taps-analytics-for-growth.html"" target=""_blank"">an analytics-driven Order Management Execution System that the company launched in December 2014</a>.Big Data and the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) are intimately connected: billions of Internet-connected “things” will, by definition, generate massive amounts of data. By 2020, the world would have generated around 40 zettabytes of data, or 5,127 gigabytes per individual, according to an estimate by research firm International Data Corp. It’s no wonder that in 2006, market researcher Clive Humby declared data to be “the new oil”. Companies are sharpening their focus on analysing this deluge of data to understand consumer behaviour patterns. A report by software body Nasscom and Blueocean Market Intelligence, a global analytics and insight provider, predicts that the Indian analytics market will cross the $2 billion mark by this fiscal year.Companies are using Big Data analytics for everything—driving growth, reducing costs, improving operations and recruiting better people.A major portion of orders of e-commerce firms now come through their analytics-driven systems. These firms record the purchasing behaviour of buyers and customize things for them. Travel firms, on their part, use data analytics to understand their customers—from basic things like their travel patterns, the kind of hotels they like to stay in, who their typical co-travellers are, their experiences—all geared to giving the customer a personalized experience the next time the customer visits the website.In hospitals, intelligence derived from data helps improve patient care through quicker and more accurate diagnoses, drug dosage recommendations and the prediction of potential side effects. Millions of electronic medical records, public health data and claims records are being analysed.Predictive healthcare using wearables to check vital medical signs and remote diagnostics could cut patient waiting times, according to a 13 January report by the McKinsey Global Institute. International Business Machines Corp.’s Watson, a cluster of computers that combines artificial intelligence and advanced analytics software and works as a “question answering” system, is being used for a variety of applications, most notably in oncology, the branch of medicine that deals with cancer. Watson for Oncology helps physicians quickly identify key information in a patient’s medical records, sift through tons of data and come up with most optimal medical choices.Many companies globally and in India, including some start-ups, are using machine-learning tools to infuse intelligence in their business by using predictive models. Popular machine-learning applications include Google’s self-driving car, online recommendations from e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Flipkart, online dating service Tinder and streaming video platform Netflix. Railigent, Siemens AG’s platform for the predictive maintenance for trains, listens to the trains running over its sensors and can detect, from the sound of the wheels, which wheel is broken and when it should be replaced.Predictive algorithms are used in recruitment too. Aspiring Minds, for instance, uses algorithms powered by machine learning that draw on data to address complex issues—for instance, to accurately gauge the quality of speech in various accents against a neutral accent (also using natural language processing). This helps companies improve recruitment efficiency by over 35% and reduce voice evaluation costs by 55%.Artificial intelligence, machine-learning-based algorithms and anomaly-detection techniques will need to be used to monitor activity across networks and real-time data streams, consulting firms point out. These technologies will, for instance, let banks in India identify threats as they occur while maintaining low false positive alarm rates even for new types of threats.There are still challenges in bringing about wider technology adoption.“Our survey showed that only about 4% of companies across industries have the capabilities to use advanced data analytics to deliver tangible business value. While some oil and gas companies have invested in their analytics capabilities, many struggle to get their arms around this powerful new opportunity,” said a March 2014 note by Bain and Co..“We often find that senior executives understand the concepts around Big Data and advanced analytics, but their teams have difficulty defining the path to value creation and the implications for technology strategy, operating model and organization. Too often, companies delegate the task of capturing value from better analytics to the IT department, as a technology project,” the note pointed out.In the 2006 movie <i>Deja Vu</i>, law enforcement agents investigate an explosion on a ferry that kills over 500 people, including a large group of party-going sailors. They use a new program that uses satellite technology to look back in time for four-and-a-half days—to try to capture the terrorist.Predictive policing is surely not as advanced today. And advances in predictive analytics can certainly raise ethical issues. For instance, the police may in the future be able to predict who might become a serial offender, and make an intervention at an early stage to change the path followed by the person, as is the case in <i>Deja Vu</i>. Or an insurance firm may use predictions to increase the premium or even deny a user an insurance.Any disruptive technology needs checks and balances in the form of good policy if it is to deliver to its potential.",2017-05-02,"Technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains",competitor,22:20,Making predictions with Big Data

The government has a goal to install 175 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2022 and is prodding local authorities to step up the pace of permitting renewables.“The ministry of new and renewable energy has written to all states to indicate their requirement for green power to consolidate demand, as more tenders would be brought out,” Kumar said.SECI, which conducted Asia’s first onshore wind auction in February, received bids to supply wind power for Rs3.46 (5 US cents) a kilowatt-hour, much lower than feed-in tariffs of Rs4 rupees to Rs5 prevailing across India’s most windy states.Also Read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/m83GjZAfpnMj2T0sMQNhpJ/Green-energy-firms-explore-portfolio-mergers-to-aid-selloff.html"" target=""_blank"">Green energy firms explore portfolio mergers to aid sell-off</a>According to Kumar, the government thinks that 5 gigawatts to 6 gigawatts of wind capacity can be added every fiscal, and companies could be able to reach the government’s goal over the next four years.Modi’s goal calls for a doubling of India’s wind capacity to 60 gigawatts and a 10-fold increase in solar projects to 100 gigawatts.SECI already has planned to offer 750 megawatts of solar projects next month in the sunny state of Rajasthan, anticipating that contest will bring record-low bids. The auction structure forces companies to compete for contracts to sell power from renewable energy plants, encouraging them to reduce prices.The price of solar power in India fell to a record of Rs3.15 a kilowatt-hour last week in an auction for 250 megawatts earlier this month, besting February’s record of Rs3.30 a unit.“The trend in the market should continue, and I would like to think that the market hasn’t bottomed out,” Kumar said when asked if tariffs in the upcoming project could go below the Rs3 mark.Also Read:<a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/Q5Florefv9lbFwnMQhsXpO/Foreign-investors-giving-MA-deals-in-Indias-renewable-ener.html"" target=""_blank""> Foreign investors giving M&amp;A deals in India’s renewable energy sector a miss</a>Timely payments to investors backing green power also will help bring prices lower, the official said. The industry has a guarantee backed by the states, SECI, and the Reserve Bank of India, which is the national central bank. This agreement has been executed with 23 states, and SECI expects the remaining to come on board soon, he added.India’s green-power ambitions have been at risk from loss-making state-run power retailers that aren’t able to buy enough power and have run behind on payments to several domestic and overseas clean-energy companies, racking up deficits of several hundred million dollars.The upcoming 750-megawatt solar park is split into a 500-megawatt project offering five contracts to build 100 megawatts and a 250-megawatt piece where investors can bid chunks of at least 50 megawatts.Kumar said the larger piece was oversubscribed 11 times and the smaller one by 13 times when the bids were submitted by investors on Wednesday. The firms bidding included companies from the Middle East and other locations new to India’s renewables auctions.Infrastructure development and finance group IL&amp;FS has developed the 500-megawatt solar park by acquiring land for installations and building power evacuation systems, while the same has been done for the remaining 250-megawatt portion by Indian conglomerate Adani group.The solar park charges for the IL&amp;FS group facility are Rs0.42 crore a megawatt, while that for the Adani group’s park are Rs0.36 crore, SECI General Manager Sanjay Sharma said.

-0.35,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"">At first glance, the letter from the Delhi police commissioner’s desk could have easily been dismissed as  another routine laundry list of his department’s “achievements” in the previous year.A closer look at the letter, written a little over two years ago, would have sprung a pleasant surprise in the context of the city police’s technology prowess.The Delhi Police, according to the letter, had partnered with the Indian Space Research Organisation to implement CMAPS—Crime Mapping, Analytics and Predictive System—under the “Effective use of Space Technology-based Tools for Internal Security Scheme” initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014.CMAPS generates crime-reporting queries and has the capacity to identify crime hotspots by auto sweep on the Dial 100 database every 1-3 minutes, replacing a Delhi Police crime-mapping tool that involved manual gathering of data every 15 days. It performs trend analysis, compiles crime and criminal profiles and analyses the behaviour of suspected offenders—all with accompanying graphics. CMAPs also has a security module for VIP threat rating, based on vulnerability of the potential target and the security deployed, and advanced predictive analysis, among other features.A prototype of the standalone version was installed at the Delhi Police control room in June 2015. The software’s statistical models and algorithms today help the police carry out “predictive policing” to forecast where the next crime is likely to occur, much like in cities such as London, Los Angeles, Kent and Berlin.That’s just one example of how technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains.Fintech start-up Lendingkart Technologies has developed tools based on big data analytics to help lenders evaluate borrowers’ creditworthiness. Using these tools, its sister company Lendingkart Finance Ltd aims to transform small business lending by providing easy access to credit for small and medium enterprises.The “technology platform has helped create a highly operational efficiency model that enables swift loan disbursement within 72 hours of loan application. Over 120,000 SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) have till date reached out to Lendingkart Finance for their credit needs,” the company said.Accenture Labs and Akshaya Patra, the world’s largest NGO-run midday meal programme, said on Thursday that they had partnered in a project to “exponentially increase the number of meals served to children in schools in India that are run and aided by the government”.Using “disruptive technology”, they hope to potentially “improve efficiency by 20%, which could boost the number of meals served by millions”.Accenture Labs began the project with a “strategic assessment and design thinking, then developed a prototype for improving kitchen operations and outcomes”. An example of Akshaya Patra’s transformation, according to Thursday’s statement, was its move “from manual collection of feedback from children and schools to a more efficient technology-based solution” that involved the use of blockchain (the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin) and sensor-enabled devices to gather feedback digitally, and use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to “predict the next day’s meal requirements”. Consider another example. Until even early 2015, the thousands of distributors of consumer goods firm Marico Ltd in Mumbai used to place orders and wait “almost a day” before getting the goods delivered. Now it takes just 10-15 minutes for an order to be delivered, helping them stock fewer goods. In turn, the lower inventory helps them cut down on warehouse space and pare costs, besides reducing the waiting time for trucks. All these distributors have benefited from <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/PkjAud0lcXFc2H9egy0JQP/Marico-taps-analytics-for-growth.html"" target=""_blank"">an analytics-driven Order Management Execution System that the company launched in December 2014</a>.Big Data and the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) are intimately connected: billions of Internet-connected “things” will, by definition, generate massive amounts of data. By 2020, the world would have generated around 40 zettabytes of data, or 5,127 gigabytes per individual, according to an estimate by research firm International Data Corp. It’s no wonder that in 2006, market researcher Clive Humby declared data to be “the new oil”. Companies are sharpening their focus on analysing this deluge of data to understand consumer behaviour patterns. A report by software body Nasscom and Blueocean Market Intelligence, a global analytics and insight provider, predicts that the Indian analytics market will cross the $2 billion mark by this fiscal year.Companies are using Big Data analytics for everything—driving growth, reducing costs, improving operations and recruiting better people.A major portion of orders of e-commerce firms now come through their analytics-driven systems. These firms record the purchasing behaviour of buyers and customize things for them. Travel firms, on their part, use data analytics to understand their customers—from basic things like their travel patterns, the kind of hotels they like to stay in, who their typical co-travellers are, their experiences—all geared to giving the customer a personalized experience the next time the customer visits the website.In hospitals, intelligence derived from data helps improve patient care through quicker and more accurate diagnoses, drug dosage recommendations and the prediction of potential side effects. Millions of electronic medical records, public health data and claims records are being analysed.Predictive healthcare using wearables to check vital medical signs and remote diagnostics could cut patient waiting times, according to a 13 January report by the McKinsey Global Institute. International Business Machines Corp.’s Watson, a cluster of computers that combines artificial intelligence and advanced analytics software and works as a “question answering” system, is being used for a variety of applications, most notably in oncology, the branch of medicine that deals with cancer. Watson for Oncology helps physicians quickly identify key information in a patient’s medical records, sift through tons of data and come up with most optimal medical choices.Many companies globally and in India, including some start-ups, are using machine-learning tools to infuse intelligence in their business by using predictive models. Popular machine-learning applications include Google’s self-driving car, online recommendations from e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Flipkart, online dating service Tinder and streaming video platform Netflix. Railigent, Siemens AG’s platform for the predictive maintenance for trains, listens to the trains running over its sensors and can detect, from the sound of the wheels, which wheel is broken and when it should be replaced.Predictive algorithms are used in recruitment too. Aspiring Minds, for instance, uses algorithms powered by machine learning that draw on data to address complex issues—for instance, to accurately gauge the quality of speech in various accents against a neutral accent (also using natural language processing). This helps companies improve recruitment efficiency by over 35% and reduce voice evaluation costs by 55%.Artificial intelligence, machine-learning-based algorithms and anomaly-detection techniques will need to be used to monitor activity across networks and real-time data streams, consulting firms point out. These technologies will, for instance, let banks in India identify threats as they occur while maintaining low false positive alarm rates even for new types of threats.There are still challenges in bringing about wider technology adoption.“Our survey showed that only about 4% of companies across industries have the capabilities to use advanced data analytics to deliver tangible business value. While some oil and gas companies have invested in their analytics capabilities, many struggle to get their arms around this powerful new opportunity,” said a March 2014 note by Bain and Co..“We often find that senior executives understand the concepts around Big Data and advanced analytics, but their teams have difficulty defining the path to value creation and the implications for technology strategy, operating model and organization. Too often, companies delegate the task of capturing value from better analytics to the IT department, as a technology project,” the note pointed out.In the 2006 movie <i>Deja Vu</i>, law enforcement agents investigate an explosion on a ferry that kills over 500 people, including a large group of party-going sailors. They use a new program that uses satellite technology to look back in time for four-and-a-half days—to try to capture the terrorist.Predictive policing is surely not as advanced today. And advances in predictive analytics can certainly raise ethical issues. For instance, the police may in the future be able to predict who might become a serial offender, and make an intervention at an early stage to change the path followed by the person, as is the case in <i>Deja Vu</i>. Or an insurance firm may use predictions to increase the premium or even deny a user an insurance.Any disruptive technology needs checks and balances in the form of good policy if it is to deliver to its potential.",2017-05-02,"Technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains",competitor,22:20,Making predictions with Big Data

Now, an analyst at a foreign brokerage has suggested that the company is better off without the target.ALSO READ: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Money/JbzPzyPMJdV4ZBhqSyxkbK/Has-Infosyss-recovery-dissipated-before-it-even-started.html"" target=""_blank"">Has Infosys’s recovery dissipated before it even started?</a>“Management continues to maintain ‘aspirational’ revenue and margin targets that are increasingly becoming unlikely to be achieved, in our opinion. Given Infy (Infosys) is now guiding to lower levels of both revenue growth and margins in FY18 (2017-18), we think management would be well-served to either amend or drop its aspirational targets,” Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 April. Based on its <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/hI2j9yckPHHX6PkEuKU2PK/Infosys-Q4-earnings-subdued-guidance-lower-for-201718.html"" target=""_blank"">guidance for 2017-18</a>, issued last week, Infosys expects to end the year with revenue of between $10.8 billion and $11.3 billion. Infosys maintains this target is an ambition and the management has no plans to dump it.In April 2015, Infosys first outlined its ambitious target: India’s second largest software firm wanted to become a $20 billion firm with 30% operating margin and to generate $80,000 in revenue from every employee working on a project.  In 2016, it tweaked the deadline to 2020-21. Infosys ended financial year 2015 with $8.7 billion in revenue, 25.9% in operating margin and generated $52,300 per employee.Two years later, Infosys managed a compound annual growth rate of 8.25% to increase its revenue to $10.21 billion but operating margin declined by 120 basis points to 24.7% and revenue per employee slipped to $51,400, making many question CEO Vishal Sikka’s strategy.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Not that Sikka hasn’t delivered. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17;  for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been  the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the “impossible targets.” “The industry is going through a structural change, and to make it worse, you set yourself impossible targets,” said a former EVP, who quit last year. “A large component of a senior executive’s salary is tied to company’s annual growth, which itself is linked to the long-term target.”Infosys says it outlined a target to make its employees work towards a goal and eventually help script a turnaround.“We gave this target because we believed this would help motivate employees, and help the CEO make them work towards a goal,” one board member, who was part of the goal-setting exercise, said on  condition of anonymity. “Looking back, I’m still not sure if it was a wrong step. I’m still on the fence,  thinking how and what we could have done better to make sure hopes did not run high and employees did not come under pressure.”One of the things Infosys could have avoided was linking Sikka’s salary to the target, said the second executive who quit, a former SVP. This seemed to suggest that  this was much more than an aspirational target, as the CEO himself has repeatedly said. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/nZzaphFLFUOqP1EuegR9EL/Infosys-CEO-Vishal-Sikka-takes-home-only-61-of-eligible-pay.html"" target=""_blank"">A weak performance in this year hurt Sikka</a>, who earned $6.8 million in 2016-17, less than the $7.3 million he earned in 2015-16.

-0.25,"New Delhi: The ministry of electronics and IT on Thursday issued guidelines on setting up of IT infrastructure by government departments using cloud computing technology with a clause mandating that all data must be stored within the country. The guidelines for government departments on contractual terms related to cloud services said since the data can be located in one or more discrete sites in foreign countries, therefore, the condition for data location has to be specifically mentioned in the agreement with the service provider. “The terms and conditions of the Empanelment of the Cloud Service Provider has taken care of this requirement by stating that all services including data will be guaranteed to reside in India,” the guidelines said. The cloud computing service enables its user to hire or use software, storage, servers as per requirement instead of purchasing the whole system. Meity has empanelled 11 companies for providing cloud computing services to government departments which include Microsoft Corp., Hewlett Packard, IBM India ,Tata Communications, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), Net Magic IT Services, Sify Technologies and CtrlS Data Centers. Cloud computing can help government departments expand capacity of their IT system as per need and even for short period and quickly start any online service. The cloud computing system can be of help to departments specially in handling sudden load of web traffic generated to access their websites like in case of train ticket booking, form filling or tax submission on a last date etc. “...the department is required to move away from the traditional fixed payment model to a variable pricing / utility pricing model where the department pays for the resources it actually uses during that period. The payment terms have to be structured accordingly to pay only for the resources used by the department,” a separate set of guideline issued for cloud services procurement said. The guidelines on cloud computing follows MeghRaj Policy (cloud policy) to provide strategic direction for adoption of cloud services by the government. The aim of the cloud policy is to realise a comprehensive vision of a government cloud (GI Cloud) environment available for use by central and state government line departments, districts and municipalities to accelerate their ICT-enabled service improvements. As per the guidelines, both cloud service provider (CSP) and government department will have to share responsibility for the managing services provisioned using cloud computing facility.“The CSP’s part in this shared responsibility includes providing its services on a highly secure and controlled platform and providing a wide array of security features customers can use.

Kumar, presiding member of NCLT, in the March order. Under the new Companies Act, shareholders are required to hold 10% equity to be qualified to file such a petition. The Act does not define equity to mean only ordinary equity.The two Mistry firms own a combined 18.4% of ordinary equity shares of the Tata group holding firm, but their holding falls below 10% when preference shares are taken into account. According to the Tatas, Mistry firms hold only about 2.17% then.Later, in an order passed on 17 April, NCLT said it would not waive the 10% requirement for the Mistry firms to file the petition. It makes sense for Mistry’s firms to approach the appellate body on maintainability and waiver separately as the legal arguments put forward on the two issues were different, said Ramesh Vaidyanathan, founder and managing partner at Advaya Legal, a law firm.The plea on maintainability was based on the fact that equity shareholding of the Mistry firms is above the threshold of 10%. The waiver arguments were on why the tribunal should waive the threshold requirement, said Vaidyanathan. While arguing in favour of the waiver, the Mistry firms had cited concerns on voting and veto rights accorded to Tata trustees on the board of Tata Sons.“Assuming that the petitioners are likely to approach the tribunal on waiver and main petition being dismissed, the tribunal may consider merging the appeal against dismissal of maintainability and waiver. This is because the urgency to deal with this matter is no longer there,” added Vaidyanathan. As the final order of the 17 April hearing is yet to be released, the firms could not have clubbed the waiver and maintainability petitions, said the first of the two people cited earlier. In a setback to Mistry and his family firms, the NCLT in its 17 April hearing not only refused to grant a waiver from the shareholding requirement, but also <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/6FpejrVtvJSI0rjb5SC0vO/NCLT-dismisses-Cyrus-Mistry-petitions-against-Tata-Sons.html"" target=""_blank"">dismissed the main petition alleging mismanagement and oppression</a>.The appellate authority typically doesn’t interfere with a decision by the lower authority unless there’s been a gross injustice, said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner at law firm IC Legal. “They (Mistry camp) really will have to bring in something substantial to the appellate tribunal to override the ruling of the lower authority,” he said.

More broadly, uncertainty over the review announced this week has unsettled Grishma and many others like her.She will have to wait until at least around August to learn her fate, but having accepted the US job offer she is not in a position to apply for positions elsewhere, including in Europe. “It’s pretty debilitating,” Grishma told <i>Reuters</i>. “I’d like to start work to mitigate the financial damage.”Trump’s decision was not a huge surprise, given his election campaign pledge to put American jobs first.Also read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Politics/4ItpsVUuXrtimX2wLZXlnL/H1B-visa-curbs-India-threatens-US-with-trade-retaliation.html"">H-1B visa curbs—India talks tough, signals it may hit back at US</a>But the executive order he signed, though vague in many areas, has prompted thousands of foreign workers already in the United States or applying for visas to work there to re-think their plans. Companies who send them also face huge uncertainty.The concerns are particularly acute in India, where IT firms like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd are top beneficiaries of the H1B visa programme, using it to send computer engineers to service clients in the United States, their largest overseas market.Companies and staff realignExperts say Trump’s order to review visa processes is aimed at firms like TCS, Infosys and Wipro, which from 2005-14 snagged around 86,000 H1B visas, roughly equivalent to the number of H1B visas the United States issues in total each year.Two industry people aware of the matter said Infosys, India’s no. 2 information technology (IT) services company, is applying for just under 1,000 H1B visas this year, which one of the people said was down from 6,500 applications in 2016 and some 9,000 in 2015.It was not clear whether the sharp reduction in 2017 was in direct response to Trump’s presidency, although the company has said for some time it wanted to cut dependence on “fly-in” staff. TCS, Infosys and Wipro said they would not share data on the number of H1B visas they had applied for this year.With fewer visas going to Infosys, more might become available for smaller IT companies and big US tech companies, like Facebook and Microsoft Corp, that typically send in fewer H1B applications each year.US-based immigration lawyer Murali Bashyam, managing partner of Bashyam Spiro LLP which advises and works with small to mid-sized Indian IT firms, said clients had been in contact seeking clarity, while the number of visa applicants had fallen.“I think the reason for that is they get the sense that it’s going to get so much tougher to comply with all of the changes ... that it might not be worth their money,” he said. “There is a fear that radical immigration changes are coming, and if those radical immigration changes come then it could completely change the way IT staffing companies do business.”Bashyam said the number of people on H1B visas already working in the United States who were considering returning to their home country had risen.An engineer working at Cisco, who has been in the United States since 2011, said that three months ago he would not have considered returning to India. But the review of the visa system, and any rule change that revoked the right for his wife to work in the United States on a dependent visa, could force him to change his mind.“If that happens, then I would definitely be interested in going back to India. Even though I’m secure, I don’t want to be in a situation where my wife cannot work,” said the engineer, who declined to be named. “Those who have heavily invested here, who’ve bought houses, property and are still on visas, are afraid.”‘I’m looking eastward’According to Bashyam, some Indians on H1B visas were cancelling plans to return home to visit their families in case they had problems getting back into the United States. “With everything that’s going on, travelling outside the US is the biggest fear for a lot of the H1B workers working in the IT staffing industry,” he said.And the uncertainty is not limited to IT. Trump’s campaign rhetoric around tighter visa rules has led some Indian students considering studying abroad to look beyond the United States, which typically draws in over 1,00,000 Indian students annually.One Canadian official said the number of student visa applications for certain courses in Canada had spiked over 250% since Trump’s election win in November.Akshay Baliga, a management consultant with a H1B visa that is valid until 2018, said he was not considering returning to the United States for work any time soon. “As a professional I’m looking eastward,” said Baliga, now based in India but who earlier studied and lived for years in America.

Kumar, presiding member of NCLT, in the March order. Under the new Companies Act, shareholders are required to hold 10% equity to be qualified to file such a petition. The Act does not define equity to mean only ordinary equity.The two Mistry firms own a combined 18.4% of ordinary equity shares of the Tata group holding firm, but their holding falls below 10% when preference shares are taken into account. According to the Tatas, Mistry firms hold only about 2.17% then.Later, in an order passed on 17 April, NCLT said it would not waive the 10% requirement for the Mistry firms to file the petition. It makes sense for Mistry’s firms to approach the appellate body on maintainability and waiver separately as the legal arguments put forward on the two issues were different, said Ramesh Vaidyanathan, founder and managing partner at Advaya Legal, a law firm.The plea on maintainability was based on the fact that equity shareholding of the Mistry firms is above the threshold of 10%. The waiver arguments were on why the tribunal should waive the threshold requirement, said Vaidyanathan. While arguing in favour of the waiver, the Mistry firms had cited concerns on voting and veto rights accorded to Tata trustees on the board of Tata Sons.“Assuming that the petitioners are likely to approach the tribunal on waiver and main petition being dismissed, the tribunal may consider merging the appeal against dismissal of maintainability and waiver. This is because the urgency to deal with this matter is no longer there,” added Vaidyanathan. As the final order of the 17 April hearing is yet to be released, the firms could not have clubbed the waiver and maintainability petitions, said the first of the two people cited earlier. In a setback to Mistry and his family firms, the NCLT in its 17 April hearing not only refused to grant a waiver from the shareholding requirement, but also <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/6FpejrVtvJSI0rjb5SC0vO/NCLT-dismisses-Cyrus-Mistry-petitions-against-Tata-Sons.html"" target=""_blank"">dismissed the main petition alleging mismanagement and oppression</a>.The appellate authority typically doesn’t interfere with a decision by the lower authority unless there’s been a gross injustice, said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner at law firm IC Legal. “They (Mistry camp) really will have to bring in something substantial to the appellate tribunal to override the ruling of the lower authority,” he said.

Now, an analyst at a foreign brokerage has suggested that the company is better off without the target.ALSO READ: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Money/JbzPzyPMJdV4ZBhqSyxkbK/Has-Infosyss-recovery-dissipated-before-it-even-started.html"" target=""_blank"">Has Infosys’s recovery dissipated before it even started?</a>“Management continues to maintain ‘aspirational’ revenue and margin targets that are increasingly becoming unlikely to be achieved, in our opinion. Given Infy (Infosys) is now guiding to lower levels of both revenue growth and margins in FY18 (2017-18), we think management would be well-served to either amend or drop its aspirational targets,” Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 April. Based on its <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/hI2j9yckPHHX6PkEuKU2PK/Infosys-Q4-earnings-subdued-guidance-lower-for-201718.html"" target=""_blank"">guidance for 2017-18</a>, issued last week, Infosys expects to end the year with revenue of between $10.8 billion and $11.3 billion. Infosys maintains this target is an ambition and the management has no plans to dump it.In April 2015, Infosys first outlined its ambitious target: India’s second largest software firm wanted to become a $20 billion firm with 30% operating margin and to generate $80,000 in revenue from every employee working on a project.  In 2016, it tweaked the deadline to 2020-21. Infosys ended financial year 2015 with $8.7 billion in revenue, 25.9% in operating margin and generated $52,300 per employee.Two years later, Infosys managed a compound annual growth rate of 8.25% to increase its revenue to $10.21 billion but operating margin declined by 120 basis points to 24.7% and revenue per employee slipped to $51,400, making many question CEO Vishal Sikka’s strategy.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Not that Sikka hasn’t delivered. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17;  for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been  the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the “impossible targets.” “The industry is going through a structural change, and to make it worse, you set yourself impossible targets,” said a former EVP, who quit last year. “A large component of a senior executive’s salary is tied to company’s annual growth, which itself is linked to the long-term target.”Infosys says it outlined a target to make its employees work towards a goal and eventually help script a turnaround.“We gave this target because we believed this would help motivate employees, and help the CEO make them work towards a goal,” one board member, who was part of the goal-setting exercise, said on  condition of anonymity. “Looking back, I’m still not sure if it was a wrong step. I’m still on the fence,  thinking how and what we could have done better to make sure hopes did not run high and employees did not come under pressure.”One of the things Infosys could have avoided was linking Sikka’s salary to the target, said the second executive who quit, a former SVP. This seemed to suggest that  this was much more than an aspirational target, as the CEO himself has repeatedly said. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/nZzaphFLFUOqP1EuegR9EL/Infosys-CEO-Vishal-Sikka-takes-home-only-61-of-eligible-pay.html"" target=""_blank"">A weak performance in this year hurt Sikka</a>, who earned $6.8 million in 2016-17, less than the $7.3 million he earned in 2015-16.

It is a general practice for companies to have long-term goals. Wipro, under Abidali Neemuchwala, has outlined an ambition to become $15 billion firm with a 23% margin by March 2020.

The volume of daily cashless transactions has increased from Rs150 crore to Rs400 crore per day since the 8 November demonetization of high-value banknotes that created a cash crunch.So far, 38,128 retail outlets have been equipped with point-of-sale (PoS) machines. More than 86% of the outlets have infrastructure for digital payment transactions. “Most of the petrol pumps have opted for digital infrastructure such as micro ATMs and e-wallets since demonetization. However, the cashless drive can be accelerated further with the adoption of BharatQR or a standardized quick response (QR) code across all the retail outlets,” said Sunil Kulkarni, deputy managing director, Oxigen Services (India) Pvt. Ltd, a payment company.To incentivize cashless payments, Pradhan said that the government had on 8 December announced a discount of 0.75% for purchase of petrol/diesel through credit/debit cards and e-wallets, at fuel retail outlets run by OMCs. It came into effect from 13 December.The burden of the discount is being borne by state-owned OMCs Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp.

-0.52,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is seeking to step up the pace of auctioning power-purchase contracts for wind-energy plants, building on a contest that reaped record-low prices for solar farms earlier this month.The government plans to offer deals covering almost 4 gigawatts of wind capacity in the current fiscal year ending March 2018 in addition to 750 megawatts of solar capacity it will tender next month, Ashvini Kumar, managing director at Solar Energy Corp. of India, the country’s implementing agency for renewable targets, told reporters in New Delhi.Modi is seeking to expand renewables to help balance India’s burgeoning needs for electricity against efforts to clear the skies of pollution. The government has a goal to install 175 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2022 and is prodding local authorities to step up the pace of permitting renewables.“The ministry of new and renewable energy has written to all states to indicate their requirement for green power to consolidate demand, as more tenders would be brought out,” Kumar said.SECI, which conducted Asia’s first onshore wind auction in February, received bids to supply wind power for Rs3.46 (5 US cents) a kilowatt-hour, much lower than feed-in tariffs of Rs4 rupees to Rs5 prevailing across India’s most windy states.Also Read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/m83GjZAfpnMj2T0sMQNhpJ/Green-energy-firms-explore-portfolio-mergers-to-aid-selloff.html"" target=""_blank"">Green energy firms explore portfolio mergers to aid sell-off</a>According to Kumar, the government thinks that 5 gigawatts to 6 gigawatts of wind capacity can be added every fiscal, and companies could be able to reach the government’s goal over the next four years.Modi’s goal calls for a doubling of India’s wind capacity to 60 gigawatts and a 10-fold increase in solar projects to 100 gigawatts.SECI already has planned to offer 750 megawatts of solar projects next month in the sunny state of Rajasthan, anticipating that contest will bring record-low bids. The auction structure forces companies to compete for contracts to sell power from renewable energy plants, encouraging them to reduce prices.The price of solar power in India fell to a record of Rs3.15 a kilowatt-hour last week in an auction for 250 megawatts earlier this month, besting February’s record of Rs3.30 a unit.“The trend in the market should continue, and I would like to think that the market hasn’t bottomed out,” Kumar said when asked if tariffs in the upcoming project could go below the Rs3 mark.Also Read:<a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/Q5Florefv9lbFwnMQhsXpO/Foreign-investors-giving-MA-deals-in-Indias-renewable-ener.html"" target=""_blank""> Foreign investors giving M&amp;A deals in India’s renewable energy sector a miss</a>Timely payments to investors backing green power also will help bring prices lower, the official said. The industry has a guarantee backed by the states, SECI, and the Reserve Bank of India, which is the national central bank. This agreement has been executed with 23 states, and SECI expects the remaining to come on board soon, he added.India’s green-power ambitions have been at risk from loss-making state-run power retailers that aren’t able to buy enough power and have run behind on payments to several domestic and overseas clean-energy companies, racking up deficits of several hundred million dollars.The upcoming 750-megawatt solar park is split into a 500-megawatt project offering five contracts to build 100 megawatts and a 250-megawatt piece where investors can bid chunks of at least 50 megawatts.Kumar said the larger piece was oversubscribed 11 times and the smaller one by 13 times when the bids were submitted by investors on Wednesday. The firms bidding included companies from the Middle East and other locations new to India’s renewables auctions.Infrastructure development and finance group IL&amp;FS has developed the 500-megawatt solar park by acquiring land for installations and building power evacuation systems, while the same has been done for the remaining 250-megawatt portion by Indian conglomerate Adani group.The solar park charges for the IL&amp;FS group facility are Rs0.42 crore a megawatt, while that for the Adani group’s park are Rs0.36 crore, SECI General Manager Sanjay Sharma said.

It performs trend analysis, compiles crime and criminal profiles and analyses the behaviour of suspected offenders—all with accompanying graphics. CMAPs also has a security module for VIP threat rating, based on vulnerability of the potential target and the security deployed, and advanced predictive analysis, among other features.A prototype of the standalone version was installed at the Delhi Police control room in June 2015. The software’s statistical models and algorithms today help the police carry out “predictive policing” to forecast where the next crime is likely to occur, much like in cities such as London, Los Angeles, Kent and Berlin.That’s just one example of how technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains.Fintech start-up Lendingkart Technologies has developed tools based on big data analytics to help lenders evaluate borrowers’ creditworthiness. Using these tools, its sister company Lendingkart Finance Ltd aims to transform small business lending by providing easy access to credit for small and medium enterprises.The “technology platform has helped create a highly operational efficiency model that enables swift loan disbursement within 72 hours of loan application. Over 120,000 SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) have till date reached out to Lendingkart Finance for their credit needs,” the company said.Accenture Labs and Akshaya Patra, the world’s largest NGO-run midday meal programme, said on Thursday that they had partnered in a project to “exponentially increase the number of meals served to children in schools in India that are run and aided by the government”.Using “disruptive technology”, they hope to potentially “improve efficiency by 20%, which could boost the number of meals served by millions”.Accenture Labs began the project with a “strategic assessment and design thinking, then developed a prototype for improving kitchen operations and outcomes”. An example of Akshaya Patra’s transformation, according to Thursday’s statement, was its move “from manual collection of feedback from children and schools to a more efficient technology-based solution” that involved the use of blockchain (the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin) and sensor-enabled devices to gather feedback digitally, and use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to “predict the next day’s meal requirements”. Consider another example. Until even early 2015, the thousands of distributors of consumer goods firm Marico Ltd in Mumbai used to place orders and wait “almost a day” before getting the goods delivered. Now it takes just 10-15 minutes for an order to be delivered, helping them stock fewer goods. In turn, the lower inventory helps them cut down on warehouse space and pare costs, besides reducing the waiting time for trucks. All these distributors have benefited from <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/PkjAud0lcXFc2H9egy0JQP/Marico-taps-analytics-for-growth.html"" target=""_blank"">an analytics-driven Order Management Execution System that the company launched in December 2014</a>.Big Data and the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) are intimately connected: billions of Internet-connected “things” will, by definition, generate massive amounts of data. By 2020, the world would have generated around 40 zettabytes of data, or 5,127 gigabytes per individual, according to an estimate by research firm International Data Corp. It’s no wonder that in 2006, market researcher Clive Humby declared data to be “the new oil”. Companies are sharpening their focus on analysing this deluge of data to understand consumer behaviour patterns. A report by software body Nasscom and Blueocean Market Intelligence, a global analytics and insight provider, predicts that the Indian analytics market will cross the $2 billion mark by this fiscal year.Companies are using Big Data analytics for everything—driving growth, reducing costs, improving operations and recruiting better people.A major portion of orders of e-commerce firms now come through their analytics-driven systems. These firms record the purchasing behaviour of buyers and customize things for them. Travel firms, on their part, use data analytics to understand their customers—from basic things like their travel patterns, the kind of hotels they like to stay in, who their typical co-travellers are, their experiences—all geared to giving the customer a personalized experience the next time the customer visits the website.In hospitals, intelligence derived from data helps improve patient care through quicker and more accurate diagnoses, drug dosage recommendations and the prediction of potential side effects. Millions of electronic medical records, public health data and claims records are being analysed.Predictive healthcare using wearables to check vital medical signs and remote diagnostics could cut patient waiting times, according to a 13 January report by the McKinsey Global Institute. International Business Machines Corp.’s Watson, a cluster of computers that combines artificial intelligence and advanced analytics software and works as a “question answering” system, is being used for a variety of applications, most notably in oncology, the branch of medicine that deals with cancer. Watson for Oncology helps physicians quickly identify key information in a patient’s medical records, sift through tons of data and come up with most optimal medical choices.Many companies globally and in India, including some start-ups, are using machine-learning tools to infuse intelligence in their business by using predictive models. Popular machine-learning applications include Google’s self-driving car, online recommendations from e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Flipkart, online dating service Tinder and streaming video platform Netflix. Railigent, Siemens AG’s platform for the predictive maintenance for trains, listens to the trains running over its sensors and can detect, from the sound of the wheels, which wheel is broken and when it should be replaced.Predictive algorithms are used in recruitment too. Aspiring Minds, for instance, uses algorithms powered by machine learning that draw on data to address complex issues—for instance, to accurately gauge the quality of speech in various accents against a neutral accent (also using natural language processing). This helps companies improve recruitment efficiency by over 35% and reduce voice evaluation costs by 55%.Artificial intelligence, machine-learning-based algorithms and anomaly-detection techniques will need to be used to monitor activity across networks and real-time data streams, consulting firms point out. These technologies will, for instance, let banks in India identify threats as they occur while maintaining low false positive alarm rates even for new types of threats.There are still challenges in bringing about wider technology adoption.“Our survey showed that only about 4% of companies across industries have the capabilities to use advanced data analytics to deliver tangible business value. While some oil and gas companies have invested in their analytics capabilities, many struggle to get their arms around this powerful new opportunity,” said a March 2014 note by Bain and Co..“We often find that senior executives understand the concepts around Big Data and advanced analytics, but their teams have difficulty defining the path to value creation and the implications for technology strategy, operating model and organization. Too often, companies delegate the task of capturing value from better analytics to the IT department, as a technology project,” the note pointed out.In the 2006 movie <i>Deja Vu</i>, law enforcement agents investigate an explosion on a ferry that kills over 500 people, including a large group of party-going sailors. They use a new program that uses satellite technology to look back in time for four-and-a-half days—to try to capture the terrorist.Predictive policing is surely not as advanced today. And advances in predictive analytics can certainly raise ethical issues. For instance, the police may in the future be able to predict who might become a serial offender, and make an intervention at an early stage to change the path followed by the person, as is the case in <i>Deja Vu</i>. Or an insurance firm may use predictions to increase the premium or even deny a user an insurance.Any disruptive technology needs checks and balances in the form of good policy if it is to deliver to its potential.",2017-05-02,"Technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains",competitor,22:20,Making predictions with Big Data

Cyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltd moved the NCLAT on Wednesday against the 6 March order by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that the petition was non-maintainable, said two people aware of the development who requested anonymity.The office of Mistry, who was ousted as Tata Sons chairman on 24 October, declined to comment. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/1IO7g0PBh6Z4S0D52hQuUP/NCLT-says-Mistry-family-firms-petition-not-maintainable.html"" target=""_blank"">NCLT had ruled that Cyrus Investments and Sterling Investments were not qualified to file the petition</a> alleging mismanagement and oppression of minority shareholders at Tata Sons, the holding company of the $103 billion Tata group.“The petitioners have failed to convince the court that the application is maintainable,” said B.S.V. Kumar, presiding member of NCLT, in the March order. Under the new Companies Act, shareholders are required to hold 10% equity to be qualified to file such a petition. The Act does not define equity to mean only ordinary equity.The two Mistry firms own a combined 18.4% of ordinary equity shares of the Tata group holding firm, but their holding falls below 10% when preference shares are taken into account. According to the Tatas, Mistry firms hold only about 2.17% then.Later, in an order passed on 17 April, NCLT said it would not waive the 10% requirement for the Mistry firms to file the petition. It makes sense for Mistry’s firms to approach the appellate body on maintainability and waiver separately as the legal arguments put forward on the two issues were different, said Ramesh Vaidyanathan, founder and managing partner at Advaya Legal, a law firm.The plea on maintainability was based on the fact that equity shareholding of the Mistry firms is above the threshold of 10%. The waiver arguments were on why the tribunal should waive the threshold requirement, said Vaidyanathan. While arguing in favour of the waiver, the Mistry firms had cited concerns on voting and veto rights accorded to Tata trustees on the board of Tata Sons.“Assuming that the petitioners are likely to approach the tribunal on waiver and main petition being dismissed, the tribunal may consider merging the appeal against dismissal of maintainability and waiver.

-0.61,"Mumbai: For Grishma, an Indian software designer, President Donald Trump’s review of the visa programme for bringing highly skilled workers into the United States comes at a bad time.Fresh from gaining a master’s degree in Europe, and with an offer of employment from a well-known US design firm, she was well on her way to fulfilling the ambition of many young Indian IT workers—a dream job in America.But as she waits in the H1B visa queue for the green light, she is caught in a bind. “It’s a weird time to be applying, with all the scrutiny,” said Grishma, who gave only her first name for fear of jeopardising her chances of getting a visa.The United States has already suspended the “expedited processing option” for applicants, under which she may have received a visa in weeks. More broadly, uncertainty over the review announced this week has unsettled Grishma and many others like her.She will have to wait until at least around August to learn her fate, but having accepted the US job offer she is not in a position to apply for positions elsewhere, including in Europe. “It’s pretty debilitating,” Grishma told <i>Reuters</i>. “I’d like to start work to mitigate the financial damage.”Trump’s decision was not a huge surprise, given his election campaign pledge to put American jobs first.Also read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Politics/4ItpsVUuXrtimX2wLZXlnL/H1B-visa-curbs-India-threatens-US-with-trade-retaliation.html"">H-1B visa curbs—India talks tough, signals it may hit back at US</a>But the executive order he signed, though vague in many areas, has prompted thousands of foreign workers already in the United States or applying for visas to work there to re-think their plans. Companies who send them also face huge uncertainty.The concerns are particularly acute in India, where IT firms like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd are top beneficiaries of the H1B visa programme, using it to send computer engineers to service clients in the United States, their largest overseas market.Companies and staff realignExperts say Trump’s order to review visa processes is aimed at firms like TCS, Infosys and Wipro, which from 2005-14 snagged around 86,000 H1B visas, roughly equivalent to the number of H1B visas the United States issues in total each year.Two industry people aware of the matter said Infosys, India’s no. 2 information technology (IT) services company, is applying for just under 1,000 H1B visas this year, which one of the people said was down from 6,500 applications in 2016 and some 9,000 in 2015.It was not clear whether the sharp reduction in 2017 was in direct response to Trump’s presidency, although the company has said for some time it wanted to cut dependence on “fly-in” staff. TCS, Infosys and Wipro said they would not share data on the number of H1B visas they had applied for this year.With fewer visas going to Infosys, more might become available for smaller IT companies and big US tech companies, like Facebook and Microsoft Corp, that typically send in fewer H1B applications each year.US-based immigration lawyer Murali Bashyam, managing partner of Bashyam Spiro LLP which advises and works with small to mid-sized Indian IT firms, said clients had been in contact seeking clarity, while the number of visa applicants had fallen.“I think the reason for that is they get the sense that it’s going to get so much tougher to comply with all of the changes ... that it might not be worth their money,” he said. “There is a fear that radical immigration changes are coming, and if those radical immigration changes come then it could completely change the way IT staffing companies do business.”Bashyam said the number of people on H1B visas already working in the United States who were considering returning to their home country had risen.An engineer working at Cisco, who has been in the United States since 2011, said that three months ago he would not have considered returning to India. But the review of the visa system, and any rule change that revoked the right for his wife to work in the United States on a dependent visa, could force him to change his mind.“If that happens, then I would definitely be interested in going back to India. Even though I’m secure, I don’t want to be in a situation where my wife cannot work,” said the engineer, who declined to be named. “Those who have heavily invested here, who’ve bought houses, property and are still on visas, are afraid.”‘I’m looking eastward’According to Bashyam, some Indians on H1B visas were cancelling plans to return home to visit their families in case they had problems getting back into the United States. “With everything that’s going on, travelling outside the US is the biggest fear for a lot of the H1B workers working in the IT staffing industry,” he said.And the uncertainty is not limited to IT. Trump’s campaign rhetoric around tighter visa rules has led some Indian students considering studying abroad to look beyond the United States, which typically draws in over 1,00,000 Indian students annually.One Canadian official said the number of student visa applications for certain courses in Canada had spiked over 250% since Trump’s election win in November.Akshay Baliga, a management consultant with a H1B visa that is valid until 2018, said he was not considering returning to the United States for work any time soon. “As a professional I’m looking eastward,” said Baliga, now based in India but who earlier studied and lived for years in America.

-0.13,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"">Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd, despite a relatively good performance over the past two years, is battling perceptions of under-performance because of its inability to keep pace with its ambitious target of more than doubling its revenue to $20 billion by March 2021.This target appears to have done more harm than good: analysts continue to rate the company using it as a metric; and people in the know attribute the departure of at least a few senior executives over the past few years to it. Now, an analyst at a foreign brokerage has suggested that the company is better off without the target.ALSO READ: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Money/JbzPzyPMJdV4ZBhqSyxkbK/Has-Infosyss-recovery-dissipated-before-it-even-started.html"" target=""_blank"">Has Infosys’s recovery dissipated before it even started?</a>“Management continues to maintain ‘aspirational’ revenue and margin targets that are increasingly becoming unlikely to be achieved, in our opinion. Given Infy (Infosys) is now guiding to lower levels of both revenue growth and margins in FY18 (2017-18), we think management would be well-served to either amend or drop its aspirational targets,” Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 April. Based on its <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/hI2j9yckPHHX6PkEuKU2PK/Infosys-Q4-earnings-subdued-guidance-lower-for-201718.html"" target=""_blank"">guidance for 2017-18</a>, issued last week, Infosys expects to end the year with revenue of between $10.8 billion and $11.3 billion. Infosys maintains this target is an ambition and the management has no plans to dump it.In April 2015, Infosys first outlined its ambitious target: India’s second largest software firm wanted to become a $20 billion firm with 30% operating margin and to generate $80,000 in revenue from every employee working on a project.  In 2016, it tweaked the deadline to 2020-21. Infosys ended financial year 2015 with $8.7 billion in revenue, 25.9% in operating margin and generated $52,300 per employee.Two years later, Infosys managed a compound annual growth rate of 8.25% to increase its revenue to $10.21 billion but operating margin declined by 120 basis points to 24.7% and revenue per employee slipped to $51,400, making many question CEO Vishal Sikka’s strategy.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Not that Sikka hasn’t delivered. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17;  for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been  the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the “impossible targets.” “The industry is going through a structural change, and to make it worse, you set yourself impossible targets,” said a former EVP, who quit last year. “A large component of a senior executive’s salary is tied to company’s annual growth, which itself is linked to the long-term target.”Infosys says it outlined a target to make its employees work towards a goal and eventually help script a turnaround.“We gave this target because we believed this would help motivate employees, and help the CEO make them work towards a goal,” one board member, who was part of the goal-setting exercise, said on  condition of anonymity. “Looking back, I’m still not sure if it was a wrong step. I’m still on the fence,  thinking how and what we could have done better to make sure hopes did not run high and employees did not come under pressure.”One of the things Infosys could have avoided was linking Sikka’s salary to the target, said the second executive who quit, a former SVP. This seemed to suggest that  this was much more than an aspirational target, as the CEO himself has repeatedly said. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/nZzaphFLFUOqP1EuegR9EL/Infosys-CEO-Vishal-Sikka-takes-home-only-61-of-eligible-pay.html"" target=""_blank"">A weak performance in this year hurt Sikka</a>, who earned $6.8 million in 2016-17, less than the $7.3 million he earned in 2015-16. Sikka got $3.8 million of the promised $8 million performance-related pay, despite a clause in his employment contract that guaranteed him at least 90% of his $11 million salary (including bonuses). It is a general practice for companies to have long-term goals. Wipro, under Abidali Neemuchwala, has outlined an ambition to become $15 billion firm with a 23% margin by March 2020.

-0.35,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"">At first glance, the letter from the Delhi police commissioner’s desk could have easily been dismissed as  another routine laundry list of his department’s “achievements” in the previous year.A closer look at the letter, written a little over two years ago, would have sprung a pleasant surprise in the context of the city police’s technology prowess.The Delhi Police, according to the letter, had partnered with the Indian Space Research Organisation to implement CMAPS—Crime Mapping, Analytics and Predictive System—under the “Effective use of Space Technology-based Tools for Internal Security Scheme” initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014.CMAPS generates crime-reporting queries and has the capacity to identify crime hotspots by auto sweep on the Dial 100 database every 1-3 minutes, replacing a Delhi Police crime-mapping tool that involved manual gathering of data every 15 days. It performs trend analysis, compiles crime and criminal profiles and analyses the behaviour of suspected offenders—all with accompanying graphics. CMAPs also has a security module for VIP threat rating, based on vulnerability of the potential target and the security deployed, and advanced predictive analysis, among other features.A prototype of the standalone version was installed at the Delhi Police control room in June 2015. The software’s statistical models and algorithms today help the police carry out “predictive policing” to forecast where the next crime is likely to occur, much like in cities such as London, Los Angeles, Kent and Berlin.That’s just one example of how technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains.Fintech start-up Lendingkart Technologies has developed tools based on big data analytics to help lenders evaluate borrowers’ creditworthiness. Using these tools, its sister company Lendingkart Finance Ltd aims to transform small business lending by providing easy access to credit for small and medium enterprises.The “technology platform has helped create a highly operational efficiency model that enables swift loan disbursement within 72 hours of loan application. Over 120,000 SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) have till date reached out to Lendingkart Finance for their credit needs,” the company said.Accenture Labs and Akshaya Patra, the world’s largest NGO-run midday meal programme, said on Thursday that they had partnered in a project to “exponentially increase the number of meals served to children in schools in India that are run and aided by the government”.Using “disruptive technology”, they hope to potentially “improve efficiency by 20%, which could boost the number of meals served by millions”.Accenture Labs began the project with a “strategic assessment and design thinking, then developed a prototype for improving kitchen operations and outcomes”. An example of Akshaya Patra’s transformation, according to Thursday’s statement, was its move “from manual collection of feedback from children and schools to a more efficient technology-based solution” that involved the use of blockchain (the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin) and sensor-enabled devices to gather feedback digitally, and use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to “predict the next day’s meal requirements”. Consider another example. Until even early 2015, the thousands of distributors of consumer goods firm Marico Ltd in Mumbai used to place orders and wait “almost a day” before getting the goods delivered. Now it takes just 10-15 minutes for an order to be delivered, helping them stock fewer goods. In turn, the lower inventory helps them cut down on warehouse space and pare costs, besides reducing the waiting time for trucks. All these distributors have benefited from <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/PkjAud0lcXFc2H9egy0JQP/Marico-taps-analytics-for-growth.html"" target=""_blank"">an analytics-driven Order Management Execution System that the company launched in December 2014</a>.Big Data and the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) are intimately connected: billions of Internet-connected “things” will, by definition, generate massive amounts of data. By 2020, the world would have generated around 40 zettabytes of data, or 5,127 gigabytes per individual, according to an estimate by research firm International Data Corp. It’s no wonder that in 2006, market researcher Clive Humby declared data to be “the new oil”. Companies are sharpening their focus on analysing this deluge of data to understand consumer behaviour patterns. A report by software body Nasscom and Blueocean Market Intelligence, a global analytics and insight provider, predicts that the Indian analytics market will cross the $2 billion mark by this fiscal year.Companies are using Big Data analytics for everything—driving growth, reducing costs, improving operations and recruiting better people.A major portion of orders of e-commerce firms now come through their analytics-driven systems. These firms record the purchasing behaviour of buyers and customize things for them. Travel firms, on their part, use data analytics to understand their customers—from basic things like their travel patterns, the kind of hotels they like to stay in, who their typical co-travellers are, their experiences—all geared to giving the customer a personalized experience the next time the customer visits the website.In hospitals, intelligence derived from data helps improve patient care through quicker and more accurate diagnoses, drug dosage recommendations and the prediction of potential side effects. Millions of electronic medical records, public health data and claims records are being analysed.Predictive healthcare using wearables to check vital medical signs and remote diagnostics could cut patient waiting times, according to a 13 January report by the McKinsey Global Institute. International Business Machines Corp.’s Watson, a cluster of computers that combines artificial intelligence and advanced analytics software and works as a “question answering” system, is being used for a variety of applications, most notably in oncology, the branch of medicine that deals with cancer. Watson for Oncology helps physicians quickly identify key information in a patient’s medical records, sift through tons of data and come up with most optimal medical choices.Many companies globally and in India, including some start-ups, are using machine-learning tools to infuse intelligence in their business by using predictive models. Popular machine-learning applications include Google’s self-driving car, online recommendations from e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Flipkart, online dating service Tinder and streaming video platform Netflix. Railigent, Siemens AG’s platform for the predictive maintenance for trains, listens to the trains running over its sensors and can detect, from the sound of the wheels, which wheel is broken and when it should be replaced.Predictive algorithms are used in recruitment too. Aspiring Minds, for instance, uses algorithms powered by machine learning that draw on data to address complex issues—for instance, to accurately gauge the quality of speech in various accents against a neutral accent (also using natural language processing). This helps companies improve recruitment efficiency by over 35% and reduce voice evaluation costs by 55%.Artificial intelligence, machine-learning-based algorithms and anomaly-detection techniques will need to be used to monitor activity across networks and real-time data streams, consulting firms point out. These technologies will, for instance, let banks in India identify threats as they occur while maintaining low false positive alarm rates even for new types of threats.There are still challenges in bringing about wider technology adoption.“Our survey showed that only about 4% of companies across industries have the capabilities to use advanced data analytics to deliver tangible business value. While some oil and gas companies have invested in their analytics capabilities, many struggle to get their arms around this powerful new opportunity,” said a March 2014 note by Bain and Co..“We often find that senior executives understand the concepts around Big Data and advanced analytics, but their teams have difficulty defining the path to value creation and the implications for technology strategy, operating model and organization. Too often, companies delegate the task of capturing value from better analytics to the IT department, as a technology project,” the note pointed out.In the 2006 movie <i>Deja Vu</i>, law enforcement agents investigate an explosion on a ferry that kills over 500 people, including a large group of party-going sailors. They use a new program that uses satellite technology to look back in time for four-and-a-half days—to try to capture the terrorist.Predictive policing is surely not as advanced today. And advances in predictive analytics can certainly raise ethical issues. For instance, the police may in the future be able to predict who might become a serial offender, and make an intervention at an early stage to change the path followed by the person, as is the case in <i>Deja Vu</i>. Or an insurance firm may use predictions to increase the premium or even deny a user an insurance.Any disruptive technology needs checks and balances in the form of good policy if it is to deliver to its potential.",2017-05-02,"Technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains",competitor,22:20,Making predictions with Big Data

-0.52,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is seeking to step up the pace of auctioning power-purchase contracts for wind-energy plants, building on a contest that reaped record-low prices for solar farms earlier this month.The government plans to offer deals covering almost 4 gigawatts of wind capacity in the current fiscal year ending March 2018 in addition to 750 megawatts of solar capacity it will tender next month, Ashvini Kumar, managing director at Solar Energy Corp. of India, the country’s implementing agency for renewable targets, told reporters in New Delhi.Modi is seeking to expand renewables to help balance India’s burgeoning needs for electricity against efforts to clear the skies of pollution. The government has a goal to install 175 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2022 and is prodding local authorities to step up the pace of permitting renewables.“The ministry of new and renewable energy has written to all states to indicate their requirement for green power to consolidate demand, as more tenders would be brought out,” Kumar said.SECI, which conducted Asia’s first onshore wind auction in February, received bids to supply wind power for Rs3.46 (5 US cents) a kilowatt-hour, much lower than feed-in tariffs of Rs4 rupees to Rs5 prevailing across India’s most windy states.Also Read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/m83GjZAfpnMj2T0sMQNhpJ/Green-energy-firms-explore-portfolio-mergers-to-aid-selloff.html"" target=""_blank"">Green energy firms explore portfolio mergers to aid sell-off</a>According to Kumar, the government thinks that 5 gigawatts to 6 gigawatts of wind capacity can be added every fiscal, and companies could be able to reach the government’s goal over the next four years.Modi’s goal calls for a doubling of India’s wind capacity to 60 gigawatts and a 10-fold increase in solar projects to 100 gigawatts.SECI already has planned to offer 750 megawatts of solar projects next month in the sunny state of Rajasthan, anticipating that contest will bring record-low bids. The auction structure forces companies to compete for contracts to sell power from renewable energy plants, encouraging them to reduce prices.The price of solar power in India fell to a record of Rs3.15 a kilowatt-hour last week in an auction for 250 megawatts earlier this month, besting February’s record of Rs3.30 a unit.“The trend in the market should continue, and I would like to think that the market hasn’t bottomed out,” Kumar said when asked if tariffs in the upcoming project could go below the Rs3 mark.Also Read:<a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/Q5Florefv9lbFwnMQhsXpO/Foreign-investors-giving-MA-deals-in-Indias-renewable-ener.html"" target=""_blank""> Foreign investors giving M&amp;A deals in India’s renewable energy sector a miss</a>Timely payments to investors backing green power also will help bring prices lower, the official said. The industry has a guarantee backed by the states, SECI, and the Reserve Bank of India, which is the national central bank. This agreement has been executed with 23 states, and SECI expects the remaining to come on board soon, he added.India’s green-power ambitions have been at risk from loss-making state-run power retailers that aren’t able to buy enough power and have run behind on payments to several domestic and overseas clean-energy companies, racking up deficits of several hundred million dollars.The upcoming 750-megawatt solar park is split into a 500-megawatt project offering five contracts to build 100 megawatts and a 250-megawatt piece where investors can bid chunks of at least 50 megawatts.Kumar said the larger piece was oversubscribed 11 times and the smaller one by 13 times when the bids were submitted by investors on Wednesday. The firms bidding included companies from the Middle East and other locations new to India’s renewables auctions.Infrastructure development and finance group IL&amp;FS has developed the 500-megawatt solar park by acquiring land for installations and building power evacuation systems, while the same has been done for the remaining 250-megawatt portion by Indian conglomerate Adani group.The solar park charges for the IL&amp;FS group facility are Rs0.42 crore a megawatt, while that for the Adani group’s park are Rs0.36 crore, SECI General Manager Sanjay Sharma said.

0.21,"New Delhi: Top industrialist Ratan Tata on Saturday praised the judicial process for its “professionalism and fairness”, days after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) rejected Cyrus Mistry’s plea against Tata Sons Ltd. Following the ouster of Mistry as Tata Sons chairman in October last year, there has been lot of acrimony between him and the Tatas. Earlier this week, the NCLT dismissed Mistry’s petition against the group. Against this backdrop, Ratan Tata has expressed his “appreciation to all those involved in the NCLT, and particularly the high integrity of the judicial process”. Asserting that it is not about winning or losing, Tata said in a tweet, “it is all about the pride one gets in witnessing the high integrity of our judiciary, the fairness and the competence of everybody in the process”. He also said that fairness and justice, if upheld, will make the nation “great”. “I can only express my greatest admiration for the professionalism and fairness of the legal process and express my appreciation to all concerned,” Tata said. Earlier this week, the NCLT dismissed the waiver application by the Mistry camp filed against Tata Sons.

Cyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltd moved the NCLAT on Wednesday against the 6 March order by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that the petition was non-maintainable, said two people aware of the development who requested anonymity.The office of Mistry, who was ousted as Tata Sons chairman on 24 October, declined to comment. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/1IO7g0PBh6Z4S0D52hQuUP/NCLT-says-Mistry-family-firms-petition-not-maintainable.html"" target=""_blank"">NCLT had ruled that Cyrus Investments and Sterling Investments were not qualified to file the petition</a> alleging mismanagement and oppression of minority shareholders at Tata Sons, the holding company of the $103 billion Tata group.“The petitioners have failed to convince the court that the application is maintainable,” said B.S.V. Kumar, presiding member of NCLT, in the March order. Under the new Companies Act, shareholders are required to hold 10% equity to be qualified to file such a petition. The Act does not define equity to mean only ordinary equity.The two Mistry firms own a combined 18.4% of ordinary equity shares of the Tata group holding firm, but their holding falls below 10% when preference shares are taken into account. According to the Tatas, Mistry firms hold only about 2.17% then.Later, in an order passed on 17 April, NCLT said it would not waive the 10% requirement for the Mistry firms to file the petition. It makes sense for Mistry’s firms to approach the appellate body on maintainability and waiver separately as the legal arguments put forward on the two issues were different, said Ramesh Vaidyanathan, founder and managing partner at Advaya Legal, a law firm.The plea on maintainability was based on the fact that equity shareholding of the Mistry firms is above the threshold of 10%. The waiver arguments were on why the tribunal should waive the threshold requirement, said Vaidyanathan. While arguing in favour of the waiver, the Mistry firms had cited concerns on voting and veto rights accorded to Tata trustees on the board of Tata Sons.“Assuming that the petitioners are likely to approach the tribunal on waiver and main petition being dismissed, the tribunal may consider merging the appeal against dismissal of maintainability and waiver. This is because the urgency to deal with this matter is no longer there,” added Vaidyanathan. As the final order of the 17 April hearing is yet to be released, the firms could not have clubbed the waiver and maintainability petitions, said the first of the two people cited earlier. In a setback to Mistry and his family firms, the NCLT in its 17 April hearing not only refused to grant a waiver from the shareholding requirement, but also <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/6FpejrVtvJSI0rjb5SC0vO/NCLT-dismisses-Cyrus-Mistry-petitions-against-Tata-Sons.html"" target=""_blank"">dismissed the main petition alleging mismanagement and oppression</a>.The appellate authority typically doesn’t interfere with a decision by the lower authority unless there’s been a gross injustice, said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner at law firm IC Legal. “They (Mistry camp) really will have to bring in something substantial to the appellate tribunal to override the ruling of the lower authority,” he said. This looks unlikely as the Mistry firms would have exhausted all the options and played their best card, he said, adding that from here on, more than anything, it’s going to be a time-consuming exercise.",2017-04-22,"Cyrus Mistry’s investment firms filed a petition at NCLAT on 19 April, challenging the 6 March order of NCLT declaring the main petition non-maintainable",company,01:41,Cyrus Mistry’s family firms challenge NCLT order on maintainability at NCLAT

-0.61,"Mumbai: For Grishma, an Indian software designer, President Donald Trump’s review of the visa programme for bringing highly skilled workers into the United States comes at a bad time.Fresh from gaining a master’s degree in Europe, and with an offer of employment from a well-known US design firm, she was well on her way to fulfilling the ambition of many young Indian IT workers—a dream job in America.But as she waits in the H1B visa queue for the green light, she is caught in a bind. “It’s a weird time to be applying, with all the scrutiny,” said Grishma, who gave only her first name for fear of jeopardising her chances of getting a visa.The United States has already suspended the “expedited processing option” for applicants, under which she may have received a visa in weeks. More broadly, uncertainty over the review announced this week has unsettled Grishma and many others like her.She will have to wait until at least around August to learn her fate, but having accepted the US job offer she is not in a position to apply for positions elsewhere, including in Europe. “It’s pretty debilitating,” Grishma told <i>Reuters</i>. “I’d like to start work to mitigate the financial damage.”Trump’s decision was not a huge surprise, given his election campaign pledge to put American jobs first.Also read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Politics/4ItpsVUuXrtimX2wLZXlnL/H1B-visa-curbs-India-threatens-US-with-trade-retaliation.html"">H-1B visa curbs—India talks tough, signals it may hit back at US</a>But the executive order he signed, though vague in many areas, has prompted thousands of foreign workers already in the United States or applying for visas to work there to re-think their plans. Companies who send them also face huge uncertainty.The concerns are particularly acute in India, where IT firms like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd are top beneficiaries of the H1B visa programme, using it to send computer engineers to service clients in the United States, their largest overseas market.Companies and staff realignExperts say Trump’s order to review visa processes is aimed at firms like TCS, Infosys and Wipro, which from 2005-14 snagged around 86,000 H1B visas, roughly equivalent to the number of H1B visas the United States issues in total each year.Two industry people aware of the matter said Infosys, India’s no. 2 information technology (IT) services company, is applying for just under 1,000 H1B visas this year, which one of the people said was down from 6,500 applications in 2016 and some 9,000 in 2015.It was not clear whether the sharp reduction in 2017 was in direct response to Trump’s presidency, although the company has said for some time it wanted to cut dependence on “fly-in” staff. TCS, Infosys and Wipro said they would not share data on the number of H1B visas they had applied for this year.With fewer visas going to Infosys, more might become available for smaller IT companies and big US tech companies, like Facebook and Microsoft Corp, that typically send in fewer H1B applications each year.US-based immigration lawyer Murali Bashyam, managing partner of Bashyam Spiro LLP which advises and works with small to mid-sized Indian IT firms, said clients had been in contact seeking clarity, while the number of visa applicants had fallen.“I think the reason for that is they get the sense that it’s going to get so much tougher to comply with all of the changes ... that it might not be worth their money,” he said. “There is a fear that radical immigration changes are coming, and if those radical immigration changes come then it could completely change the way IT staffing companies do business.”Bashyam said the number of people on H1B visas already working in the United States who were considering returning to their home country had risen.An engineer working at Cisco, who has been in the United States since 2011, said that three months ago he would not have considered returning to India. But the review of the visa system, and any rule change that revoked the right for his wife to work in the United States on a dependent visa, could force him to change his mind.“If that happens, then I would definitely be interested in going back to India. Even though I’m secure, I don’t want to be in a situation where my wife cannot work,” said the engineer, who declined to be named. “Those who have heavily invested here, who’ve bought houses, property and are still on visas, are afraid.”‘I’m looking eastward’According to Bashyam, some Indians on H1B visas were cancelling plans to return home to visit their families in case they had problems getting back into the United States. “With everything that’s going on, travelling outside the US is the biggest fear for a lot of the H1B workers working in the IT staffing industry,” he said.And the uncertainty is not limited to IT. Trump’s campaign rhetoric around tighter visa rules has led some Indian students considering studying abroad to look beyond the United States, which typically draws in over 1,00,000 Indian students annually.One Canadian official said the number of student visa applications for certain courses in Canada had spiked over 250% since Trump’s election win in November.Akshay Baliga, a management consultant with a H1B visa that is valid until 2018, said he was not considering returning to the United States for work any time soon. “As a professional I’m looking eastward,” said Baliga, now based in India but who earlier studied and lived for years in America.

Infosys maintains this target is an ambition and the management has no plans to dump it.In April 2015, Infosys first outlined its ambitious target: India’s second largest software firm wanted to become a $20 billion firm with 30% operating margin and to generate $80,000 in revenue from every employee working on a project.  In 2016, it tweaked the deadline to 2020-21. Infosys ended financial year 2015 with $8.7 billion in revenue, 25.9% in operating margin and generated $52,300 per employee.Two years later, Infosys managed a compound annual growth rate of 8.25% to increase its revenue to $10.21 billion but operating margin declined by 120 basis points to 24.7% and revenue per employee slipped to $51,400, making many question CEO Vishal Sikka’s strategy.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Not that Sikka hasn’t delivered. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17;  for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been  the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the “impossible targets.” “The industry is going through a structural change, and to make it worse, you set yourself impossible targets,” said a former EVP, who quit last year. “A large component of a senior executive’s salary is tied to company’s annual growth, which itself is linked to the long-term target.”Infosys says it outlined a target to make its employees work towards a goal and eventually help script a turnaround.“We gave this target because we believed this would help motivate employees, and help the CEO make them work towards a goal,” one board member, who was part of the goal-setting exercise, said on  condition of anonymity. “Looking back, I’m still not sure if it was a wrong step. I’m still on the fence,  thinking how and what we could have done better to make sure hopes did not run high and employees did not come under pressure.”One of the things Infosys could have avoided was linking Sikka’s salary to the target, said the second executive who quit, a former SVP. This seemed to suggest that  this was much more than an aspirational target, as the CEO himself has repeatedly said. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/nZzaphFLFUOqP1EuegR9EL/Infosys-CEO-Vishal-Sikka-takes-home-only-61-of-eligible-pay.html"" target=""_blank"">A weak performance in this year hurt Sikka</a>, who earned $6.8 million in 2016-17, less than the $7.3 million he earned in 2015-16. Sikka got $3.8 million of the promised $8 million performance-related pay, despite a clause in his employment contract that guaranteed him at least 90% of his $11 million salary (including bonuses). It is a general practice for companies to have long-term goals. Wipro, under Abidali Neemuchwala, has outlined an ambition to become $15 billion firm with a 23% margin by March 2020. India’s fifth largest software firm, Tech Mahindra Ltd, too has set a goal of more than doubling revenue to $10 billion by March 2020.",2017-04-21,"Vishal Sikka’s ambitious revenue target, which Infosys is struggling to keep pace with, seems to have done more harm than good",competitor,02:43,Infosys weighed down by $20 billion revenue target set by Vishal Sikka

-0.52,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is seeking to step up the pace of auctioning power-purchase contracts for wind-energy plants, building on a contest that reaped record-low prices for solar farms earlier this month.The government plans to offer deals covering almost 4 gigawatts of wind capacity in the current fiscal year ending March 2018 in addition to 750 megawatts of solar capacity it will tender next month, Ashvini Kumar, managing director at Solar Energy Corp. of India, the country’s implementing agency for renewable targets, told reporters in New Delhi.Modi is seeking to expand renewables to help balance India’s burgeoning needs for electricity against efforts to clear the skies of pollution. The government has a goal to install 175 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2022 and is prodding local authorities to step up the pace of permitting renewables.“The ministry of new and renewable energy has written to all states to indicate their requirement for green power to consolidate demand, as more tenders would be brought out,” Kumar said.SECI, which conducted Asia’s first onshore wind auction in February, received bids to supply wind power for Rs3.46 (5 US cents) a kilowatt-hour, much lower than feed-in tariffs of Rs4 rupees to Rs5 prevailing across India’s most windy states.Also Read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/m83GjZAfpnMj2T0sMQNhpJ/Green-energy-firms-explore-portfolio-mergers-to-aid-selloff.html"" target=""_blank"">Green energy firms explore portfolio mergers to aid sell-off</a>According to Kumar, the government thinks that 5 gigawatts to 6 gigawatts of wind capacity can be added every fiscal, and companies could be able to reach the government’s goal over the next four years.Modi’s goal calls for a doubling of India’s wind capacity to 60 gigawatts and a 10-fold increase in solar projects to 100 gigawatts.SECI already has planned to offer 750 megawatts of solar projects next month in the sunny state of Rajasthan, anticipating that contest will bring record-low bids. The auction structure forces companies to compete for contracts to sell power from renewable energy plants, encouraging them to reduce prices.The price of solar power in India fell to a record of Rs3.15 a kilowatt-hour last week in an auction for 250 megawatts earlier this month, besting February’s record of Rs3.30 a unit.“The trend in the market should continue, and I would like to think that the market hasn’t bottomed out,” Kumar said when asked if tariffs in the upcoming project could go below the Rs3 mark.Also Read:<a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/Q5Florefv9lbFwnMQhsXpO/Foreign-investors-giving-MA-deals-in-Indias-renewable-ener.html"" target=""_blank""> Foreign investors giving M&amp;A deals in India’s renewable energy sector a miss</a>Timely payments to investors backing green power also will help bring prices lower, the official said. The industry has a guarantee backed by the states, SECI, and the Reserve Bank of India, which is the national central bank. This agreement has been executed with 23 states, and SECI expects the remaining to come on board soon, he added.India’s green-power ambitions have been at risk from loss-making state-run power retailers that aren’t able to buy enough power and have run behind on payments to several domestic and overseas clean-energy companies, racking up deficits of several hundred million dollars.The upcoming 750-megawatt solar park is split into a 500-megawatt project offering five contracts to build 100 megawatts and a 250-megawatt piece where investors can bid chunks of at least 50 megawatts.Kumar said the larger piece was oversubscribed 11 times and the smaller one by 13 times when the bids were submitted by investors on Wednesday. The firms bidding included companies from the Middle East and other locations new to India’s renewables auctions.Infrastructure development and finance group IL&amp;FS has developed the 500-megawatt solar park by acquiring land for installations and building power evacuation systems, while the same has been done for the remaining 250-megawatt portion by Indian conglomerate Adani group.The solar park charges for the IL&amp;FS group facility are Rs0.42 crore a megawatt, while that for the Adani group’s park are Rs0.36 crore, SECI General Manager Sanjay Sharma said.

-0.35,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"">At first glance, the letter from the Delhi police commissioner’s desk could have easily been dismissed as  another routine laundry list of his department’s “achievements” in the previous year.A closer look at the letter, written a little over two years ago, would have sprung a pleasant surprise in the context of the city police’s technology prowess.The Delhi Police, according to the letter, had partnered with the Indian Space Research Organisation to implement CMAPS—Crime Mapping, Analytics and Predictive System—under the “Effective use of Space Technology-based Tools for Internal Security Scheme” initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014.CMAPS generates crime-reporting queries and has the capacity to identify crime hotspots by auto sweep on the Dial 100 database every 1-3 minutes, replacing a Delhi Police crime-mapping tool that involved manual gathering of data every 15 days. It performs trend analysis, compiles crime and criminal profiles and analyses the behaviour of suspected offenders—all with accompanying graphics. CMAPs also has a security module for VIP threat rating, based on vulnerability of the potential target and the security deployed, and advanced predictive analysis, among other features.A prototype of the standalone version was installed at the Delhi Police control room in June 2015. The software’s statistical models and algorithms today help the police carry out “predictive policing” to forecast where the next crime is likely to occur, much like in cities such as London, Los Angeles, Kent and Berlin.That’s just one example of how technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains.Fintech start-up Lendingkart Technologies has developed tools based on big data analytics to help lenders evaluate borrowers’ creditworthiness. Using these tools, its sister company Lendingkart Finance Ltd aims to transform small business lending by providing easy access to credit for small and medium enterprises.The “technology platform has helped create a highly operational efficiency model that enables swift loan disbursement within 72 hours of loan application. Over 120,000 SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) have till date reached out to Lendingkart Finance for their credit needs,” the company said.Accenture Labs and Akshaya Patra, the world’s largest NGO-run midday meal programme, said on Thursday that they had partnered in a project to “exponentially increase the number of meals served to children in schools in India that are run and aided by the government”.Using “disruptive technology”, they hope to potentially “improve efficiency by 20%, which could boost the number of meals served by millions”.Accenture Labs began the project with a “strategic assessment and design thinking, then developed a prototype for improving kitchen operations and outcomes”. An example of Akshaya Patra’s transformation, according to Thursday’s statement, was its move “from manual collection of feedback from children and schools to a more efficient technology-based solution” that involved the use of blockchain (the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin) and sensor-enabled devices to gather feedback digitally, and use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to “predict the next day’s meal requirements”. Consider another example. Until even early 2015, the thousands of distributors of consumer goods firm Marico Ltd in Mumbai used to place orders and wait “almost a day” before getting the goods delivered. Now it takes just 10-15 minutes for an order to be delivered, helping them stock fewer goods. In turn, the lower inventory helps them cut down on warehouse space and pare costs, besides reducing the waiting time for trucks. All these distributors have benefited from <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/PkjAud0lcXFc2H9egy0JQP/Marico-taps-analytics-for-growth.html"" target=""_blank"">an analytics-driven Order Management Execution System that the company launched in December 2014</a>.Big Data and the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) are intimately connected: billions of Internet-connected “things” will, by definition, generate massive amounts of data. By 2020, the world would have generated around 40 zettabytes of data, or 5,127 gigabytes per individual, according to an estimate by research firm International Data Corp. It’s no wonder that in 2006, market researcher Clive Humby declared data to be “the new oil”. Companies are sharpening their focus on analysing this deluge of data to understand consumer behaviour patterns. A report by software body Nasscom and Blueocean Market Intelligence, a global analytics and insight provider, predicts that the Indian analytics market will cross the $2 billion mark by this fiscal year.Companies are using Big Data analytics for everything—driving growth, reducing costs, improving operations and recruiting better people.A major portion of orders of e-commerce firms now come through their analytics-driven systems. These firms record the purchasing behaviour of buyers and customize things for them. Travel firms, on their part, use data analytics to understand their customers—from basic things like their travel patterns, the kind of hotels they like to stay in, who their typical co-travellers are, their experiences—all geared to giving the customer a personalized experience the next time the customer visits the website.In hospitals, intelligence derived from data helps improve patient care through quicker and more accurate diagnoses, drug dosage recommendations and the prediction of potential side effects. Millions of electronic medical records, public health data and claims records are being analysed.Predictive healthcare using wearables to check vital medical signs and remote diagnostics could cut patient waiting times, according to a 13 January report by the McKinsey Global Institute. International Business Machines Corp.’s Watson, a cluster of computers that combines artificial intelligence and advanced analytics software and works as a “question answering” system, is being used for a variety of applications, most notably in oncology, the branch of medicine that deals with cancer. Watson for Oncology helps physicians quickly identify key information in a patient’s medical records, sift through tons of data and come up with most optimal medical choices.Many companies globally and in India, including some start-ups, are using machine-learning tools to infuse intelligence in their business by using predictive models. Popular machine-learning applications include Google’s self-driving car, online recommendations from e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Flipkart, online dating service Tinder and streaming video platform Netflix. Railigent, Siemens AG’s platform for the predictive maintenance for trains, listens to the trains running over its sensors and can detect, from the sound of the wheels, which wheel is broken and when it should be replaced.Predictive algorithms are used in recruitment too. Aspiring Minds, for instance, uses algorithms powered by machine learning that draw on data to address complex issues—for instance, to accurately gauge the quality of speech in various accents against a neutral accent (also using natural language processing). This helps companies improve recruitment efficiency by over 35% and reduce voice evaluation costs by 55%.Artificial intelligence, machine-learning-based algorithms and anomaly-detection techniques will need to be used to monitor activity across networks and real-time data streams, consulting firms point out. These technologies will, for instance, let banks in India identify threats as they occur while maintaining low false positive alarm rates even for new types of threats.There are still challenges in bringing about wider technology adoption.“Our survey showed that only about 4% of companies across industries have the capabilities to use advanced data analytics to deliver tangible business value. While some oil and gas companies have invested in their analytics capabilities, many struggle to get their arms around this powerful new opportunity,” said a March 2014 note by Bain and Co..“We often find that senior executives understand the concepts around Big Data and advanced analytics, but their teams have difficulty defining the path to value creation and the implications for technology strategy, operating model and organization. Too often, companies delegate the task of capturing value from better analytics to the IT department, as a technology project,” the note pointed out.In the 2006 movie <i>Deja Vu</i>, law enforcement agents investigate an explosion on a ferry that kills over 500 people, including a large group of party-going sailors. They use a new program that uses satellite technology to look back in time for four-and-a-half days—to try to capture the terrorist.Predictive policing is surely not as advanced today. And advances in predictive analytics can certainly raise ethical issues. For instance, the police may in the future be able to predict who might become a serial offender, and make an intervention at an early stage to change the path followed by the person, as is the case in <i>Deja Vu</i>. Or an insurance firm may use predictions to increase the premium or even deny a user an insurance.Any disruptive technology needs checks and balances in the form of good policy if it is to deliver to its potential.",2017-05-02,"Technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains",competitor,22:20,Making predictions with Big Data

The guidelines for government departments on contractual terms related to cloud services said since the data can be located in one or more discrete sites in foreign countries, therefore, the condition for data location has to be specifically mentioned in the agreement with the service provider. “The terms and conditions of the Empanelment of the Cloud Service Provider has taken care of this requirement by stating that all services including data will be guaranteed to reside in India,” the guidelines said. The cloud computing service enables its user to hire or use software, storage, servers as per requirement instead of purchasing the whole system. Meity has empanelled 11 companies for providing cloud computing services to government departments which include Microsoft Corp., Hewlett Packard, IBM India ,Tata Communications, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), Net Magic IT Services, Sify Technologies and CtrlS Data Centers. Cloud computing can help government departments expand capacity of their IT system as per need and even for short period and quickly start any online service. The cloud computing system can be of help to departments specially in handling sudden load of web traffic generated to access their websites like in case of train ticket booking, form filling or tax submission on a last date etc. “...the department is required to move away from the traditional fixed payment model to a variable pricing / utility pricing model where the department pays for the resources it actually uses during that period. The payment terms have to be structured accordingly to pay only for the resources used by the department,” a separate set of guideline issued for cloud services procurement said. The guidelines on cloud computing follows MeghRaj Policy (cloud policy) to provide strategic direction for adoption of cloud services by the government. The aim of the cloud policy is to realise a comprehensive vision of a government cloud (GI Cloud) environment available for use by central and state government line departments, districts and municipalities to accelerate their ICT-enabled service improvements. As per the guidelines, both cloud service provider (CSP) and government department will have to share responsibility for the managing services provisioned using cloud computing facility.“The CSP’s part in this shared responsibility includes providing its services on a highly secure and controlled platform and providing a wide array of security features customers can use.

Ltd moved the NCLAT on Wednesday against the 6 March order by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that the petition was non-maintainable, said two people aware of the development who requested anonymity.The office of Mistry, who was ousted as Tata Sons chairman on 24 October, declined to comment. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/1IO7g0PBh6Z4S0D52hQuUP/NCLT-says-Mistry-family-firms-petition-not-maintainable.html"" target=""_blank"">NCLT had ruled that Cyrus Investments and Sterling Investments were not qualified to file the petition</a> alleging mismanagement and oppression of minority shareholders at Tata Sons, the holding company of the $103 billion Tata group.“The petitioners have failed to convince the court that the application is maintainable,” said B.S.V. Kumar, presiding member of NCLT, in the March order. Under the new Companies Act, shareholders are required to hold 10% equity to be qualified to file such a petition. The Act does not define equity to mean only ordinary equity.The two Mistry firms own a combined 18.4% of ordinary equity shares of the Tata group holding firm, but their holding falls below 10% when preference shares are taken into account. According to the Tatas, Mistry firms hold only about 2.17% then.Later, in an order passed on 17 April, NCLT said it would not waive the 10% requirement for the Mistry firms to file the petition. It makes sense for Mistry’s firms to approach the appellate body on maintainability and waiver separately as the legal arguments put forward on the two issues were different, said Ramesh Vaidyanathan, founder and managing partner at Advaya Legal, a law firm.The plea on maintainability was based on the fact that equity shareholding of the Mistry firms is above the threshold of 10%. The waiver arguments were on why the tribunal should waive the threshold requirement, said Vaidyanathan. While arguing in favour of the waiver, the Mistry firms had cited concerns on voting and veto rights accorded to Tata trustees on the board of Tata Sons.“Assuming that the petitioners are likely to approach the tribunal on waiver and main petition being dismissed, the tribunal may consider merging the appeal against dismissal of maintainability and waiver. This is because the urgency to deal with this matter is no longer there,” added Vaidyanathan. As the final order of the 17 April hearing is yet to be released, the firms could not have clubbed the waiver and maintainability petitions, said the first of the two people cited earlier. In a setback to Mistry and his family firms, the NCLT in its 17 April hearing not only refused to grant a waiver from the shareholding requirement, but also <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/6FpejrVtvJSI0rjb5SC0vO/NCLT-dismisses-Cyrus-Mistry-petitions-against-Tata-Sons.html"" target=""_blank"">dismissed the main petition alleging mismanagement and oppression</a>.The appellate authority typically doesn’t interfere with a decision by the lower authority unless there’s been a gross injustice, said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner at law firm IC Legal. “They (Mistry camp) really will have to bring in something substantial to the appellate tribunal to override the ruling of the lower authority,” he said. This looks unlikely as the Mistry firms would have exhausted all the options and played their best card, he said, adding that from here on, more than anything, it’s going to be a time-consuming exercise.",2017-04-22,"Cyrus Mistry’s investment firms filed a petition at NCLAT on 19 April, challenging the 6 March order of NCLT declaring the main petition non-maintainable",company,01:41,Cyrus Mistry’s family firms challenge NCLT order on maintainability at NCLAT

The volume of daily cashless transactions has increased from Rs150 crore to Rs400 crore per day since the 8 November demonetization of high-value banknotes that created a cash crunch.So far, 38,128 retail outlets have been equipped with point-of-sale (PoS) machines. More than 86% of the outlets have infrastructure for digital payment transactions. “Most of the petrol pumps have opted for digital infrastructure such as micro ATMs and e-wallets since demonetization. However, the cashless drive can be accelerated further with the adoption of BharatQR or a standardized quick response (QR) code across all the retail outlets,” said Sunil Kulkarni, deputy managing director, Oxigen Services (India) Pvt. Ltd, a payment company.To incentivize cashless payments, Pradhan said that the government had on 8 December announced a discount of 0.75% for purchase of petrol/diesel through credit/debit cards and e-wallets, at fuel retail outlets run by OMCs. It came into effect from 13 December.The burden of the discount is being borne by state-owned OMCs Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL).The oil ministry tweeted later in the day that it is exploring options to deliver petroleum products to consumers at their doorsteps on pre-booking. “This would help consumers avoid spending excessive time and long queues at fuel stations,” said the tweet.

-0.52,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is seeking to step up the pace of auctioning power-purchase contracts for wind-energy plants, building on a contest that reaped record-low prices for solar farms earlier this month.The government plans to offer deals covering almost 4 gigawatts of wind capacity in the current fiscal year ending March 2018 in addition to 750 megawatts of solar capacity it will tender next month, Ashvini Kumar, managing director at Solar Energy Corp. of India, the country’s implementing agency for renewable targets, told reporters in New Delhi.Modi is seeking to expand renewables to help balance India’s burgeoning needs for electricity against efforts to clear the skies of pollution. The government has a goal to install 175 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2022 and is prodding local authorities to step up the pace of permitting renewables.“The ministry of new and renewable energy has written to all states to indicate their requirement for green power to consolidate demand, as more tenders would be brought out,” Kumar said.SECI, which conducted Asia’s first onshore wind auction in February, received bids to supply wind power for Rs3.46 (5 US cents) a kilowatt-hour, much lower than feed-in tariffs of Rs4 rupees to Rs5 prevailing across India’s most windy states.Also Read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/m83GjZAfpnMj2T0sMQNhpJ/Green-energy-firms-explore-portfolio-mergers-to-aid-selloff.html"" target=""_blank"">Green energy firms explore portfolio mergers to aid sell-off</a>According to Kumar, the government thinks that 5 gigawatts to 6 gigawatts of wind capacity can be added every fiscal, and companies could be able to reach the government’s goal over the next four years.Modi’s goal calls for a doubling of India’s wind capacity to 60 gigawatts and a 10-fold increase in solar projects to 100 gigawatts.SECI already has planned to offer 750 megawatts of solar projects next month in the sunny state of Rajasthan, anticipating that contest will bring record-low bids. The auction structure forces companies to compete for contracts to sell power from renewable energy plants, encouraging them to reduce prices.The price of solar power in India fell to a record of Rs3.15 a kilowatt-hour last week in an auction for 250 megawatts earlier this month, besting February’s record of Rs3.30 a unit.“The trend in the market should continue, and I would like to think that the market hasn’t bottomed out,” Kumar said when asked if tariffs in the upcoming project could go below the Rs3 mark.Also Read:<a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/Q5Florefv9lbFwnMQhsXpO/Foreign-investors-giving-MA-deals-in-Indias-renewable-ener.html"" target=""_blank""> Foreign investors giving M&amp;A deals in India’s renewable energy sector a miss</a>Timely payments to investors backing green power also will help bring prices lower, the official said. The industry has a guarantee backed by the states, SECI, and the Reserve Bank of India, which is the national central bank. This agreement has been executed with 23 states, and SECI expects the remaining to come on board soon, he added.India’s green-power ambitions have been at risk from loss-making state-run power retailers that aren’t able to buy enough power and have run behind on payments to several domestic and overseas clean-energy companies, racking up deficits of several hundred million dollars.The upcoming 750-megawatt solar park is split into a 500-megawatt project offering five contracts to build 100 megawatts and a 250-megawatt piece where investors can bid chunks of at least 50 megawatts.Kumar said the larger piece was oversubscribed 11 times and the smaller one by 13 times when the bids were submitted by investors on Wednesday. The firms bidding included companies from the Middle East and other locations new to India’s renewables auctions.Infrastructure development and finance group IL&amp;FS has developed the 500-megawatt solar park by acquiring land for installations and building power evacuation systems, while the same has been done for the remaining 250-megawatt portion by Indian conglomerate Adani group.The solar park charges for the IL&amp;FS group facility are Rs0.42 crore a megawatt, while that for the Adani group’s park are Rs0.36 crore, SECI General Manager Sanjay Sharma said.

-0.61,"Mumbai: For Grishma, an Indian software designer, President Donald Trump’s review of the visa programme for bringing highly skilled workers into the United States comes at a bad time.Fresh from gaining a master’s degree in Europe, and with an offer of employment from a well-known US design firm, she was well on her way to fulfilling the ambition of many young Indian IT workers—a dream job in America.But as she waits in the H1B visa queue for the green light, she is caught in a bind. “It’s a weird time to be applying, with all the scrutiny,” said Grishma, who gave only her first name for fear of jeopardising her chances of getting a visa.The United States has already suspended the “expedited processing option” for applicants, under which she may have received a visa in weeks. More broadly, uncertainty over the review announced this week has unsettled Grishma and many others like her.She will have to wait until at least around August to learn her fate, but having accepted the US job offer she is not in a position to apply for positions elsewhere, including in Europe. “It’s pretty debilitating,” Grishma told <i>Reuters</i>. “I’d like to start work to mitigate the financial damage.”Trump’s decision was not a huge surprise, given his election campaign pledge to put American jobs first.Also read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Politics/4ItpsVUuXrtimX2wLZXlnL/H1B-visa-curbs-India-threatens-US-with-trade-retaliation.html"">H-1B visa curbs—India talks tough, signals it may hit back at US</a>But the executive order he signed, though vague in many areas, has prompted thousands of foreign workers already in the United States or applying for visas to work there to re-think their plans. Companies who send them also face huge uncertainty.The concerns are particularly acute in India, where IT firms like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd are top beneficiaries of the H1B visa programme, using it to send computer engineers to service clients in the United States, their largest overseas market.Companies and staff realignExperts say Trump’s order to review visa processes is aimed at firms like TCS, Infosys and Wipro, which from 2005-14 snagged around 86,000 H1B visas, roughly equivalent to the number of H1B visas the United States issues in total each year.Two industry people aware of the matter said Infosys, India’s no. 2 information technology (IT) services company, is applying for just under 1,000 H1B visas this year, which one of the people said was down from 6,500 applications in 2016 and some 9,000 in 2015.It was not clear whether the sharp reduction in 2017 was in direct response to Trump’s presidency, although the company has said for some time it wanted to cut dependence on “fly-in” staff. TCS, Infosys and Wipro said they would not share data on the number of H1B visas they had applied for this year.With fewer visas going to Infosys, more might become available for smaller IT companies and big US tech companies, like Facebook and Microsoft Corp, that typically send in fewer H1B applications each year.US-based immigration lawyer Murali Bashyam, managing partner of Bashyam Spiro LLP which advises and works with small to mid-sized Indian IT firms, said clients had been in contact seeking clarity, while the number of visa applicants had fallen.“I think the reason for that is they get the sense that it’s going to get so much tougher to comply with all of the changes ... that it might not be worth their money,” he said. “There is a fear that radical immigration changes are coming, and if those radical immigration changes come then it could completely change the way IT staffing companies do business.”Bashyam said the number of people on H1B visas already working in the United States who were considering returning to their home country had risen.An engineer working at Cisco, who has been in the United States since 2011, said that three months ago he would not have considered returning to India. But the review of the visa system, and any rule change that revoked the right for his wife to work in the United States on a dependent visa, could force him to change his mind.“If that happens, then I would definitely be interested in going back to India. Even though I’m secure, I don’t want to be in a situation where my wife cannot work,” said the engineer, who declined to be named. “Those who have heavily invested here, who’ve bought houses, property and are still on visas, are afraid.”‘I’m looking eastward’According to Bashyam, some Indians on H1B visas were cancelling plans to return home to visit their families in case they had problems getting back into the United States. “With everything that’s going on, travelling outside the US is the biggest fear for a lot of the H1B workers working in the IT staffing industry,” he said.And the uncertainty is not limited to IT. Trump’s campaign rhetoric around tighter visa rules has led some Indian students considering studying abroad to look beyond the United States, which typically draws in over 1,00,000 Indian students annually.One Canadian official said the number of student visa applications for certain courses in Canada had spiked over 250% since Trump’s election win in November.Akshay Baliga, a management consultant with a H1B visa that is valid until 2018, said he was not considering returning to the United States for work any time soon. “As a professional I’m looking eastward,” said Baliga, now based in India but who earlier studied and lived for years in America.

-0.35,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"">At first glance, the letter from the Delhi police commissioner’s desk could have easily been dismissed as  another routine laundry list of his department’s “achievements” in the previous year.A closer look at the letter, written a little over two years ago, would have sprung a pleasant surprise in the context of the city police’s technology prowess.The Delhi Police, according to the letter, had partnered with the Indian Space Research Organisation to implement CMAPS—Crime Mapping, Analytics and Predictive System—under the “Effective use of Space Technology-based Tools for Internal Security Scheme” initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014.CMAPS generates crime-reporting queries and has the capacity to identify crime hotspots by auto sweep on the Dial 100 database every 1-3 minutes, replacing a Delhi Police crime-mapping tool that involved manual gathering of data every 15 days. It performs trend analysis, compiles crime and criminal profiles and analyses the behaviour of suspected offenders—all with accompanying graphics. CMAPs also has a security module for VIP threat rating, based on vulnerability of the potential target and the security deployed, and advanced predictive analysis, among other features.A prototype of the standalone version was installed at the Delhi Police control room in June 2015. The software’s statistical models and algorithms today help the police carry out “predictive policing” to forecast where the next crime is likely to occur, much like in cities such as London, Los Angeles, Kent and Berlin.That’s just one example of how technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains.Fintech start-up Lendingkart Technologies has developed tools based on big data analytics to help lenders evaluate borrowers’ creditworthiness. Using these tools, its sister company Lendingkart Finance Ltd aims to transform small business lending by providing easy access to credit for small and medium enterprises.The “technology platform has helped create a highly operational efficiency model that enables swift loan disbursement within 72 hours of loan application. Over 120,000 SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) have till date reached out to Lendingkart Finance for their credit needs,” the company said.Accenture Labs and Akshaya Patra, the world’s largest NGO-run midday meal programme, said on Thursday that they had partnered in a project to “exponentially increase the number of meals served to children in schools in India that are run and aided by the government”.Using “disruptive technology”, they hope to potentially “improve efficiency by 20%, which could boost the number of meals served by millions”.Accenture Labs began the project with a “strategic assessment and design thinking, then developed a prototype for improving kitchen operations and outcomes”. An example of Akshaya Patra’s transformation, according to Thursday’s statement, was its move “from manual collection of feedback from children and schools to a more efficient technology-based solution” that involved the use of blockchain (the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin) and sensor-enabled devices to gather feedback digitally, and use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to “predict the next day’s meal requirements”. Consider another example. Until even early 2015, the thousands of distributors of consumer goods firm Marico Ltd in Mumbai used to place orders and wait “almost a day” before getting the goods delivered. Now it takes just 10-15 minutes for an order to be delivered, helping them stock fewer goods. In turn, the lower inventory helps them cut down on warehouse space and pare costs, besides reducing the waiting time for trucks. All these distributors have benefited from <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/PkjAud0lcXFc2H9egy0JQP/Marico-taps-analytics-for-growth.html"" target=""_blank"">an analytics-driven Order Management Execution System that the company launched in December 2014</a>.Big Data and the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) are intimately connected: billions of Internet-connected “things” will, by definition, generate massive amounts of data. By 2020, the world would have generated around 40 zettabytes of data, or 5,127 gigabytes per individual, according to an estimate by research firm International Data Corp. It’s no wonder that in 2006, market researcher Clive Humby declared data to be “the new oil”. Companies are sharpening their focus on analysing this deluge of data to understand consumer behaviour patterns. A report by software body Nasscom and Blueocean Market Intelligence, a global analytics and insight provider, predicts that the Indian analytics market will cross the $2 billion mark by this fiscal year.Companies are using Big Data analytics for everything—driving growth, reducing costs, improving operations and recruiting better people.A major portion of orders of e-commerce firms now come through their analytics-driven systems. These firms record the purchasing behaviour of buyers and customize things for them. Travel firms, on their part, use data analytics to understand their customers—from basic things like their travel patterns, the kind of hotels they like to stay in, who their typical co-travellers are, their experiences—all geared to giving the customer a personalized experience the next time the customer visits the website.In hospitals, intelligence derived from data helps improve patient care through quicker and more accurate diagnoses, drug dosage recommendations and the prediction of potential side effects. Millions of electronic medical records, public health data and claims records are being analysed.Predictive healthcare using wearables to check vital medical signs and remote diagnostics could cut patient waiting times, according to a 13 January report by the McKinsey Global Institute. International Business Machines Corp.’s Watson, a cluster of computers that combines artificial intelligence and advanced analytics software and works as a “question answering” system, is being used for a variety of applications, most notably in oncology, the branch of medicine that deals with cancer. Watson for Oncology helps physicians quickly identify key information in a patient’s medical records, sift through tons of data and come up with most optimal medical choices.Many companies globally and in India, including some start-ups, are using machine-learning tools to infuse intelligence in their business by using predictive models. Popular machine-learning applications include Google’s self-driving car, online recommendations from e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Flipkart, online dating service Tinder and streaming video platform Netflix. Railigent, Siemens AG’s platform for the predictive maintenance for trains, listens to the trains running over its sensors and can detect, from the sound of the wheels, which wheel is broken and when it should be replaced.Predictive algorithms are used in recruitment too. Aspiring Minds, for instance, uses algorithms powered by machine learning that draw on data to address complex issues—for instance, to accurately gauge the quality of speech in various accents against a neutral accent (also using natural language processing). This helps companies improve recruitment efficiency by over 35% and reduce voice evaluation costs by 55%.Artificial intelligence, machine-learning-based algorithms and anomaly-detection techniques will need to be used to monitor activity across networks and real-time data streams, consulting firms point out. These technologies will, for instance, let banks in India identify threats as they occur while maintaining low false positive alarm rates even for new types of threats.There are still challenges in bringing about wider technology adoption.“Our survey showed that only about 4% of companies across industries have the capabilities to use advanced data analytics to deliver tangible business value. While some oil and gas companies have invested in their analytics capabilities, many struggle to get their arms around this powerful new opportunity,” said a March 2014 note by Bain and Co..“We often find that senior executives understand the concepts around Big Data and advanced analytics, but their teams have difficulty defining the path to value creation and the implications for technology strategy, operating model and organization. Too often, companies delegate the task of capturing value from better analytics to the IT department, as a technology project,” the note pointed out.In the 2006 movie <i>Deja Vu</i>, law enforcement agents investigate an explosion on a ferry that kills over 500 people, including a large group of party-going sailors. They use a new program that uses satellite technology to look back in time for four-and-a-half days—to try to capture the terrorist.Predictive policing is surely not as advanced today. And advances in predictive analytics can certainly raise ethical issues. For instance, the police may in the future be able to predict who might become a serial offender, and make an intervention at an early stage to change the path followed by the person, as is the case in <i>Deja Vu</i>. Or an insurance firm may use predictions to increase the premium or even deny a user an insurance.Any disruptive technology needs checks and balances in the form of good policy if it is to deliver to its potential.",2017-05-02,"Technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains",competitor,22:20,Making predictions with Big Data

Cloud computing can help government departments expand capacity of their IT system as per need and even for short period and quickly start any online service. The cloud computing system can be of help to departments specially in handling sudden load of web traffic generated to access their websites like in case of train ticket booking, form filling or tax submission on a last date etc. “...the department is required to move away from the traditional fixed payment model to a variable pricing / utility pricing model where the department pays for the resources it actually uses during that period. The payment terms have to be structured accordingly to pay only for the resources used by the department,” a separate set of guideline issued for cloud services procurement said. The guidelines on cloud computing follows MeghRaj Policy (cloud policy) to provide strategic direction for adoption of cloud services by the government. The aim of the cloud policy is to realise a comprehensive vision of a government cloud (GI Cloud) environment available for use by central and state government line departments, districts and municipalities to accelerate their ICT-enabled service improvements. As per the guidelines, both cloud service provider (CSP) and government department will have to share responsibility for the managing services provisioned using cloud computing facility.“The CSP’s part in this shared responsibility includes providing its services on a highly secure and controlled platform and providing a wide array of security features customers can use.

Now, an analyst at a foreign brokerage has suggested that the company is better off without the target.ALSO READ: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Money/JbzPzyPMJdV4ZBhqSyxkbK/Has-Infosyss-recovery-dissipated-before-it-even-started.html"" target=""_blank"">Has Infosys’s recovery dissipated before it even started?</a>“Management continues to maintain ‘aspirational’ revenue and margin targets that are increasingly becoming unlikely to be achieved, in our opinion. Given Infy (Infosys) is now guiding to lower levels of both revenue growth and margins in FY18 (2017-18), we think management would be well-served to either amend or drop its aspirational targets,” Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 April. Based on its <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/hI2j9yckPHHX6PkEuKU2PK/Infosys-Q4-earnings-subdued-guidance-lower-for-201718.html"" target=""_blank"">guidance for 2017-18</a>, issued last week, Infosys expects to end the year with revenue of between $10.8 billion and $11.3 billion. Infosys maintains this target is an ambition and the management has no plans to dump it.In April 2015, Infosys first outlined its ambitious target: India’s second largest software firm wanted to become a $20 billion firm with 30% operating margin and to generate $80,000 in revenue from every employee working on a project.  In 2016, it tweaked the deadline to 2020-21. Infosys ended financial year 2015 with $8.7 billion in revenue, 25.9% in operating margin and generated $52,300 per employee.Two years later, Infosys managed a compound annual growth rate of 8.25% to increase its revenue to $10.21 billion but operating margin declined by 120 basis points to 24.7% and revenue per employee slipped to $51,400, making many question CEO Vishal Sikka’s strategy.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Not that Sikka hasn’t delivered. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17;  for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been  the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the “impossible targets.” “The industry is going through a structural change, and to make it worse, you set yourself impossible targets,” said a former EVP, who quit last year. “A large component of a senior executive’s salary is tied to company’s annual growth, which itself is linked to the long-term target.”Infosys says it outlined a target to make its employees work towards a goal and eventually help script a turnaround.“We gave this target because we believed this would help motivate employees, and help the CEO make them work towards a goal,” one board member, who was part of the goal-setting exercise, said on  condition of anonymity. “Looking back, I’m still not sure if it was a wrong step. I’m still on the fence,  thinking how and what we could have done better to make sure hopes did not run high and employees did not come under pressure.”One of the things Infosys could have avoided was linking Sikka’s salary to the target, said the second executive who quit, a former SVP. This seemed to suggest that  this was much more than an aspirational target, as the CEO himself has repeatedly said. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/nZzaphFLFUOqP1EuegR9EL/Infosys-CEO-Vishal-Sikka-takes-home-only-61-of-eligible-pay.html"" target=""_blank"">A weak performance in this year hurt Sikka</a>, who earned $6.8 million in 2016-17, less than the $7.3 million he earned in 2015-16.

Against this backdrop, Ratan Tata has expressed his “appreciation to all those involved in the NCLT, and particularly the high integrity of the judicial process”. Asserting that it is not about winning or losing, Tata said in a tweet, “it is all about the pride one gets in witnessing the high integrity of our judiciary, the fairness and the competence of everybody in the process”. He also said that fairness and justice, if upheld, will make the nation “great”. “I can only express my greatest admiration for the professionalism and fairness of the legal process and express my appreciation to all concerned,” Tata said. Earlier this week, the NCLT dismissed the waiver application by the Mistry camp filed against Tata Sons. The petitions were filed by two firms belonging to Cyrus Mistry’s family, and sought waiver of an eligibility condition for moving the forum against Tata Sons. After the dismissal of the plea by the NCLT, Mistry has moved the appellate tribunal, the NCLAT.",2017-04-22,Ratan Tata’s comments come after the NCLT dismissed the waiver application by the Cyrus Mistry camp filed against Tata Sons ,company,21:01,Ratan Tata praises judicial professionalism after Cyrus Mistry plea rejection

-0.61,"Mumbai: For Grishma, an Indian software designer, President Donald Trump’s review of the visa programme for bringing highly skilled workers into the United States comes at a bad time.Fresh from gaining a master’s degree in Europe, and with an offer of employment from a well-known US design firm, she was well on her way to fulfilling the ambition of many young Indian IT workers—a dream job in America.But as she waits in the H1B visa queue for the green light, she is caught in a bind. “It’s a weird time to be applying, with all the scrutiny,” said Grishma, who gave only her first name for fear of jeopardising her chances of getting a visa.The United States has already suspended the “expedited processing option” for applicants, under which she may have received a visa in weeks. More broadly, uncertainty over the review announced this week has unsettled Grishma and many others like her.She will have to wait until at least around August to learn her fate, but having accepted the US job offer she is not in a position to apply for positions elsewhere, including in Europe. “It’s pretty debilitating,” Grishma told <i>Reuters</i>. “I’d like to start work to mitigate the financial damage.”Trump’s decision was not a huge surprise, given his election campaign pledge to put American jobs first.Also read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Politics/4ItpsVUuXrtimX2wLZXlnL/H1B-visa-curbs-India-threatens-US-with-trade-retaliation.html"">H-1B visa curbs—India talks tough, signals it may hit back at US</a>But the executive order he signed, though vague in many areas, has prompted thousands of foreign workers already in the United States or applying for visas to work there to re-think their plans. Companies who send them also face huge uncertainty.The concerns are particularly acute in India, where IT firms like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd are top beneficiaries of the H1B visa programme, using it to send computer engineers to service clients in the United States, their largest overseas market.Companies and staff realignExperts say Trump’s order to review visa processes is aimed at firms like TCS, Infosys and Wipro, which from 2005-14 snagged around 86,000 H1B visas, roughly equivalent to the number of H1B visas the United States issues in total each year.Two industry people aware of the matter said Infosys, India’s no. 2 information technology (IT) services company, is applying for just under 1,000 H1B visas this year, which one of the people said was down from 6,500 applications in 2016 and some 9,000 in 2015.It was not clear whether the sharp reduction in 2017 was in direct response to Trump’s presidency, although the company has said for some time it wanted to cut dependence on “fly-in” staff. TCS, Infosys and Wipro said they would not share data on the number of H1B visas they had applied for this year.With fewer visas going to Infosys, more might become available for smaller IT companies and big US tech companies, like Facebook and Microsoft Corp, that typically send in fewer H1B applications each year.US-based immigration lawyer Murali Bashyam, managing partner of Bashyam Spiro LLP which advises and works with small to mid-sized Indian IT firms, said clients had been in contact seeking clarity, while the number of visa applicants had fallen.“I think the reason for that is they get the sense that it’s going to get so much tougher to comply with all of the changes ... that it might not be worth their money,” he said. “There is a fear that radical immigration changes are coming, and if those radical immigration changes come then it could completely change the way IT staffing companies do business.”Bashyam said the number of people on H1B visas already working in the United States who were considering returning to their home country had risen.An engineer working at Cisco, who has been in the United States since 2011, said that three months ago he would not have considered returning to India. But the review of the visa system, and any rule change that revoked the right for his wife to work in the United States on a dependent visa, could force him to change his mind.“If that happens, then I would definitely be interested in going back to India. Even though I’m secure, I don’t want to be in a situation where my wife cannot work,” said the engineer, who declined to be named. “Those who have heavily invested here, who’ve bought houses, property and are still on visas, are afraid.”‘I’m looking eastward’According to Bashyam, some Indians on H1B visas were cancelling plans to return home to visit their families in case they had problems getting back into the United States. “With everything that’s going on, travelling outside the US is the biggest fear for a lot of the H1B workers working in the IT staffing industry,” he said.And the uncertainty is not limited to IT. Trump’s campaign rhetoric around tighter visa rules has led some Indian students considering studying abroad to look beyond the United States, which typically draws in over 1,00,000 Indian students annually.One Canadian official said the number of student visa applications for certain courses in Canada had spiked over 250% since Trump’s election win in November.Akshay Baliga, a management consultant with a H1B visa that is valid until 2018, said he was not considering returning to the United States for work any time soon. “As a professional I’m looking eastward,” said Baliga, now based in India but who earlier studied and lived for years in America.

Now, an analyst at a foreign brokerage has suggested that the company is better off without the target.ALSO READ: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Money/JbzPzyPMJdV4ZBhqSyxkbK/Has-Infosyss-recovery-dissipated-before-it-even-started.html"" target=""_blank"">Has Infosys’s recovery dissipated before it even started?</a>“Management continues to maintain ‘aspirational’ revenue and margin targets that are increasingly becoming unlikely to be achieved, in our opinion. Given Infy (Infosys) is now guiding to lower levels of both revenue growth and margins in FY18 (2017-18), we think management would be well-served to either amend or drop its aspirational targets,” Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 April. Based on its <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/hI2j9yckPHHX6PkEuKU2PK/Infosys-Q4-earnings-subdued-guidance-lower-for-201718.html"" target=""_blank"">guidance for 2017-18</a>, issued last week, Infosys expects to end the year with revenue of between $10.8 billion and $11.3 billion. Infosys maintains this target is an ambition and the management has no plans to dump it.In April 2015, Infosys first outlined its ambitious target: India’s second largest software firm wanted to become a $20 billion firm with 30% operating margin and to generate $80,000 in revenue from every employee working on a project.  In 2016, it tweaked the deadline to 2020-21. Infosys ended financial year 2015 with $8.7 billion in revenue, 25.9% in operating margin and generated $52,300 per employee.Two years later, Infosys managed a compound annual growth rate of 8.25% to increase its revenue to $10.21 billion but operating margin declined by 120 basis points to 24.7% and revenue per employee slipped to $51,400, making many question CEO Vishal Sikka’s strategy.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Not that Sikka hasn’t delivered. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17;  for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been  the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the “impossible targets.” “The industry is going through a structural change, and to make it worse, you set yourself impossible targets,” said a former EVP, who quit last year. “A large component of a senior executive’s salary is tied to company’s annual growth, which itself is linked to the long-term target.”Infosys says it outlined a target to make its employees work towards a goal and eventually help script a turnaround.“We gave this target because we believed this would help motivate employees, and help the CEO make them work towards a goal,” one board member, who was part of the goal-setting exercise, said on  condition of anonymity. “Looking back, I’m still not sure if it was a wrong step. I’m still on the fence,  thinking how and what we could have done better to make sure hopes did not run high and employees did not come under pressure.”One of the things Infosys could have avoided was linking Sikka’s salary to the target, said the second executive who quit, a former SVP. This seemed to suggest that  this was much more than an aspirational target, as the CEO himself has repeatedly said. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/nZzaphFLFUOqP1EuegR9EL/Infosys-CEO-Vishal-Sikka-takes-home-only-61-of-eligible-pay.html"" target=""_blank"">A weak performance in this year hurt Sikka</a>, who earned $6.8 million in 2016-17, less than the $7.3 million he earned in 2015-16.

-0.25,"New Delhi: The ministry of electronics and IT on Thursday issued guidelines on setting up of IT infrastructure by government departments using cloud computing technology with a clause mandating that all data must be stored within the country. The guidelines for government departments on contractual terms related to cloud services said since the data can be located in one or more discrete sites in foreign countries, therefore, the condition for data location has to be specifically mentioned in the agreement with the service provider. “The terms and conditions of the Empanelment of the Cloud Service Provider has taken care of this requirement by stating that all services including data will be guaranteed to reside in India,” the guidelines said. The cloud computing service enables its user to hire or use software, storage, servers as per requirement instead of purchasing the whole system. Meity has empanelled 11 companies for providing cloud computing services to government departments which include Microsoft Corp., Hewlett Packard, IBM India ,Tata Communications, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), Net Magic IT Services, Sify Technologies and CtrlS Data Centers. Cloud computing can help government departments expand capacity of their IT system as per need and even for short period and quickly start any online service. The cloud computing system can be of help to departments specially in handling sudden load of web traffic generated to access their websites like in case of train ticket booking, form filling or tax submission on a last date etc. “...the department is required to move away from the traditional fixed payment model to a variable pricing / utility pricing model where the department pays for the resources it actually uses during that period. The payment terms have to be structured accordingly to pay only for the resources used by the department,” a separate set of guideline issued for cloud services procurement said. The guidelines on cloud computing follows MeghRaj Policy (cloud policy) to provide strategic direction for adoption of cloud services by the government. The aim of the cloud policy is to realise a comprehensive vision of a government cloud (GI Cloud) environment available for use by central and state government line departments, districts and municipalities to accelerate their ICT-enabled service improvements. As per the guidelines, both cloud service provider (CSP) and government department will have to share responsibility for the managing services provisioned using cloud computing facility.“The CSP’s part in this shared responsibility includes providing its services on a highly secure and controlled platform and providing a wide array of security features customers can use.

-0.35,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"">At first glance, the letter from the Delhi police commissioner’s desk could have easily been dismissed as  another routine laundry list of his department’s “achievements” in the previous year.A closer look at the letter, written a little over two years ago, would have sprung a pleasant surprise in the context of the city police’s technology prowess.The Delhi Police, according to the letter, had partnered with the Indian Space Research Organisation to implement CMAPS—Crime Mapping, Analytics and Predictive System—under the “Effective use of Space Technology-based Tools for Internal Security Scheme” initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014.CMAPS generates crime-reporting queries and has the capacity to identify crime hotspots by auto sweep on the Dial 100 database every 1-3 minutes, replacing a Delhi Police crime-mapping tool that involved manual gathering of data every 15 days. It performs trend analysis, compiles crime and criminal profiles and analyses the behaviour of suspected offenders—all with accompanying graphics. CMAPs also has a security module for VIP threat rating, based on vulnerability of the potential target and the security deployed, and advanced predictive analysis, among other features.A prototype of the standalone version was installed at the Delhi Police control room in June 2015. The software’s statistical models and algorithms today help the police carry out “predictive policing” to forecast where the next crime is likely to occur, much like in cities such as London, Los Angeles, Kent and Berlin.That’s just one example of how technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains.Fintech start-up Lendingkart Technologies has developed tools based on big data analytics to help lenders evaluate borrowers’ creditworthiness. Using these tools, its sister company Lendingkart Finance Ltd aims to transform small business lending by providing easy access to credit for small and medium enterprises.The “technology platform has helped create a highly operational efficiency model that enables swift loan disbursement within 72 hours of loan application. Over 120,000 SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) have till date reached out to Lendingkart Finance for their credit needs,” the company said.Accenture Labs and Akshaya Patra, the world’s largest NGO-run midday meal programme, said on Thursday that they had partnered in a project to “exponentially increase the number of meals served to children in schools in India that are run and aided by the government”.Using “disruptive technology”, they hope to potentially “improve efficiency by 20%, which could boost the number of meals served by millions”.Accenture Labs began the project with a “strategic assessment and design thinking, then developed a prototype for improving kitchen operations and outcomes”. An example of Akshaya Patra’s transformation, according to Thursday’s statement, was its move “from manual collection of feedback from children and schools to a more efficient technology-based solution” that involved the use of blockchain (the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin) and sensor-enabled devices to gather feedback digitally, and use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to “predict the next day’s meal requirements”. Consider another example. Until even early 2015, the thousands of distributors of consumer goods firm Marico Ltd in Mumbai used to place orders and wait “almost a day” before getting the goods delivered. Now it takes just 10-15 minutes for an order to be delivered, helping them stock fewer goods. In turn, the lower inventory helps them cut down on warehouse space and pare costs, besides reducing the waiting time for trucks. All these distributors have benefited from <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/PkjAud0lcXFc2H9egy0JQP/Marico-taps-analytics-for-growth.html"" target=""_blank"">an analytics-driven Order Management Execution System that the company launched in December 2014</a>.Big Data and the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) are intimately connected: billions of Internet-connected “things” will, by definition, generate massive amounts of data. By 2020, the world would have generated around 40 zettabytes of data, or 5,127 gigabytes per individual, according to an estimate by research firm International Data Corp. It’s no wonder that in 2006, market researcher Clive Humby declared data to be “the new oil”. Companies are sharpening their focus on analysing this deluge of data to understand consumer behaviour patterns. A report by software body Nasscom and Blueocean Market Intelligence, a global analytics and insight provider, predicts that the Indian analytics market will cross the $2 billion mark by this fiscal year.Companies are using Big Data analytics for everything—driving growth, reducing costs, improving operations and recruiting better people.A major portion of orders of e-commerce firms now come through their analytics-driven systems. These firms record the purchasing behaviour of buyers and customize things for them. Travel firms, on their part, use data analytics to understand their customers—from basic things like their travel patterns, the kind of hotels they like to stay in, who their typical co-travellers are, their experiences—all geared to giving the customer a personalized experience the next time the customer visits the website.In hospitals, intelligence derived from data helps improve patient care through quicker and more accurate diagnoses, drug dosage recommendations and the prediction of potential side effects. Millions of electronic medical records, public health data and claims records are being analysed.Predictive healthcare using wearables to check vital medical signs and remote diagnostics could cut patient waiting times, according to a 13 January report by the McKinsey Global Institute. International Business Machines Corp.’s Watson, a cluster of computers that combines artificial intelligence and advanced analytics software and works as a “question answering” system, is being used for a variety of applications, most notably in oncology, the branch of medicine that deals with cancer. Watson for Oncology helps physicians quickly identify key information in a patient’s medical records, sift through tons of data and come up with most optimal medical choices.Many companies globally and in India, including some start-ups, are using machine-learning tools to infuse intelligence in their business by using predictive models. Popular machine-learning applications include Google’s self-driving car, online recommendations from e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Flipkart, online dating service Tinder and streaming video platform Netflix. Railigent, Siemens AG’s platform for the predictive maintenance for trains, listens to the trains running over its sensors and can detect, from the sound of the wheels, which wheel is broken and when it should be replaced.Predictive algorithms are used in recruitment too. Aspiring Minds, for instance, uses algorithms powered by machine learning that draw on data to address complex issues—for instance, to accurately gauge the quality of speech in various accents against a neutral accent (also using natural language processing). This helps companies improve recruitment efficiency by over 35% and reduce voice evaluation costs by 55%.Artificial intelligence, machine-learning-based algorithms and anomaly-detection techniques will need to be used to monitor activity across networks and real-time data streams, consulting firms point out. These technologies will, for instance, let banks in India identify threats as they occur while maintaining low false positive alarm rates even for new types of threats.There are still challenges in bringing about wider technology adoption.“Our survey showed that only about 4% of companies across industries have the capabilities to use advanced data analytics to deliver tangible business value. While some oil and gas companies have invested in their analytics capabilities, many struggle to get their arms around this powerful new opportunity,” said a March 2014 note by Bain and Co..“We often find that senior executives understand the concepts around Big Data and advanced analytics, but their teams have difficulty defining the path to value creation and the implications for technology strategy, operating model and organization. Too often, companies delegate the task of capturing value from better analytics to the IT department, as a technology project,” the note pointed out.In the 2006 movie <i>Deja Vu</i>, law enforcement agents investigate an explosion on a ferry that kills over 500 people, including a large group of party-going sailors. They use a new program that uses satellite technology to look back in time for four-and-a-half days—to try to capture the terrorist.Predictive policing is surely not as advanced today. And advances in predictive analytics can certainly raise ethical issues. For instance, the police may in the future be able to predict who might become a serial offender, and make an intervention at an early stage to change the path followed by the person, as is the case in <i>Deja Vu</i>. Or an insurance firm may use predictions to increase the premium or even deny a user an insurance.Any disruptive technology needs checks and balances in the form of good policy if it is to deliver to its potential.",2017-05-02,"Technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains",competitor,22:20,Making predictions with Big Data

Cyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltd moved the NCLAT on Wednesday against the 6 March order by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that the petition was non-maintainable, said two people aware of the development who requested anonymity.The office of Mistry, who was ousted as Tata Sons chairman on 24 October, declined to comment. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/1IO7g0PBh6Z4S0D52hQuUP/NCLT-says-Mistry-family-firms-petition-not-maintainable.html"" target=""_blank"">NCLT had ruled that Cyrus Investments and Sterling Investments were not qualified to file the petition</a> alleging mismanagement and oppression of minority shareholders at Tata Sons, the holding company of the $103 billion Tata group.“The petitioners have failed to convince the court that the application is maintainable,” said B.S.V. Kumar, presiding member of NCLT, in the March order. Under the new Companies Act, shareholders are required to hold 10% equity to be qualified to file such a petition. The Act does not define equity to mean only ordinary equity.The two Mistry firms own a combined 18.4% of ordinary equity shares of the Tata group holding firm, but their holding falls below 10% when preference shares are taken into account. According to the Tatas, Mistry firms hold only about 2.17% then.Later, in an order passed on 17 April, NCLT said it would not waive the 10% requirement for the Mistry firms to file the petition. It makes sense for Mistry’s firms to approach the appellate body on maintainability and waiver separately as the legal arguments put forward on the two issues were different, said Ramesh Vaidyanathan, founder and managing partner at Advaya Legal, a law firm.The plea on maintainability was based on the fact that equity shareholding of the Mistry firms is above the threshold of 10%. The waiver arguments were on why the tribunal should waive the threshold requirement, said Vaidyanathan. While arguing in favour of the waiver, the Mistry firms had cited concerns on voting and veto rights accorded to Tata trustees on the board of Tata Sons.“Assuming that the petitioners are likely to approach the tribunal on waiver and main petition being dismissed, the tribunal may consider merging the appeal against dismissal of maintainability and waiver. This is because the urgency to deal with this matter is no longer there,” added Vaidyanathan. As the final order of the 17 April hearing is yet to be released, the firms could not have clubbed the waiver and maintainability petitions, said the first of the two people cited earlier. In a setback to Mistry and his family firms, the NCLT in its 17 April hearing not only refused to grant a waiver from the shareholding requirement, but also <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/6FpejrVtvJSI0rjb5SC0vO/NCLT-dismisses-Cyrus-Mistry-petitions-against-Tata-Sons.html"" target=""_blank"">dismissed the main petition alleging mismanagement and oppression</a>.The appellate authority typically doesn’t interfere with a decision by the lower authority unless there’s been a gross injustice, said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner at law firm IC Legal. “They (Mistry camp) really will have to bring in something substantial to the appellate tribunal to override the ruling of the lower authority,” he said.

-0.52,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is seeking to step up the pace of auctioning power-purchase contracts for wind-energy plants, building on a contest that reaped record-low prices for solar farms earlier this month.The government plans to offer deals covering almost 4 gigawatts of wind capacity in the current fiscal year ending March 2018 in addition to 750 megawatts of solar capacity it will tender next month, Ashvini Kumar, managing director at Solar Energy Corp. of India, the country’s implementing agency for renewable targets, told reporters in New Delhi.Modi is seeking to expand renewables to help balance India’s burgeoning needs for electricity against efforts to clear the skies of pollution. The government has a goal to install 175 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2022 and is prodding local authorities to step up the pace of permitting renewables.“The ministry of new and renewable energy has written to all states to indicate their requirement for green power to consolidate demand, as more tenders would be brought out,” Kumar said.SECI, which conducted Asia’s first onshore wind auction in February, received bids to supply wind power for Rs3.46 (5 US cents) a kilowatt-hour, much lower than feed-in tariffs of Rs4 rupees to Rs5 prevailing across India’s most windy states.Also Read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/m83GjZAfpnMj2T0sMQNhpJ/Green-energy-firms-explore-portfolio-mergers-to-aid-selloff.html"" target=""_blank"">Green energy firms explore portfolio mergers to aid sell-off</a>According to Kumar, the government thinks that 5 gigawatts to 6 gigawatts of wind capacity can be added every fiscal, and companies could be able to reach the government’s goal over the next four years.Modi’s goal calls for a doubling of India’s wind capacity to 60 gigawatts and a 10-fold increase in solar projects to 100 gigawatts.SECI already has planned to offer 750 megawatts of solar projects next month in the sunny state of Rajasthan, anticipating that contest will bring record-low bids. The auction structure forces companies to compete for contracts to sell power from renewable energy plants, encouraging them to reduce prices.The price of solar power in India fell to a record of Rs3.15 a kilowatt-hour last week in an auction for 250 megawatts earlier this month, besting February’s record of Rs3.30 a unit.“The trend in the market should continue, and I would like to think that the market hasn’t bottomed out,” Kumar said when asked if tariffs in the upcoming project could go below the Rs3 mark.Also Read:<a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/Q5Florefv9lbFwnMQhsXpO/Foreign-investors-giving-MA-deals-in-Indias-renewable-ener.html"" target=""_blank""> Foreign investors giving M&amp;A deals in India’s renewable energy sector a miss</a>Timely payments to investors backing green power also will help bring prices lower, the official said.

Following the ouster of Mistry as Tata Sons chairman in October last year, there has been lot of acrimony between him and the Tatas. Earlier this week, the NCLT dismissed Mistry’s petition against the group. Against this backdrop, Ratan Tata has expressed his “appreciation to all those involved in the NCLT, and particularly the high integrity of the judicial process”. Asserting that it is not about winning or losing, Tata said in a tweet, “it is all about the pride one gets in witnessing the high integrity of our judiciary, the fairness and the competence of everybody in the process”. He also said that fairness and justice, if upheld, will make the nation “great”. “I can only express my greatest admiration for the professionalism and fairness of the legal process and express my appreciation to all concerned,” Tata said. Earlier this week, the NCLT dismissed the waiver application by the Mistry camp filed against Tata Sons.

Kumar, presiding member of NCLT, in the March order. Under the new Companies Act, shareholders are required to hold 10% equity to be qualified to file such a petition. The Act does not define equity to mean only ordinary equity.The two Mistry firms own a combined 18.4% of ordinary equity shares of the Tata group holding firm, but their holding falls below 10% when preference shares are taken into account. According to the Tatas, Mistry firms hold only about 2.17% then.Later, in an order passed on 17 April, NCLT said it would not waive the 10% requirement for the Mistry firms to file the petition. It makes sense for Mistry’s firms to approach the appellate body on maintainability and waiver separately as the legal arguments put forward on the two issues were different, said Ramesh Vaidyanathan, founder and managing partner at Advaya Legal, a law firm.The plea on maintainability was based on the fact that equity shareholding of the Mistry firms is above the threshold of 10%. The waiver arguments were on why the tribunal should waive the threshold requirement, said Vaidyanathan. While arguing in favour of the waiver, the Mistry firms had cited concerns on voting and veto rights accorded to Tata trustees on the board of Tata Sons.“Assuming that the petitioners are likely to approach the tribunal on waiver and main petition being dismissed, the tribunal may consider merging the appeal against dismissal of maintainability and waiver. This is because the urgency to deal with this matter is no longer there,” added Vaidyanathan. As the final order of the 17 April hearing is yet to be released, the firms could not have clubbed the waiver and maintainability petitions, said the first of the two people cited earlier.

-0.61,"Mumbai: For Grishma, an Indian software designer, President Donald Trump’s review of the visa programme for bringing highly skilled workers into the United States comes at a bad time.Fresh from gaining a master’s degree in Europe, and with an offer of employment from a well-known US design firm, she was well on her way to fulfilling the ambition of many young Indian IT workers—a dream job in America.But as she waits in the H1B visa queue for the green light, she is caught in a bind. “It’s a weird time to be applying, with all the scrutiny,” said Grishma, who gave only her first name for fear of jeopardising her chances of getting a visa.The United States has already suspended the “expedited processing option” for applicants, under which she may have received a visa in weeks. More broadly, uncertainty over the review announced this week has unsettled Grishma and many others like her.She will have to wait until at least around August to learn her fate, but having accepted the US job offer she is not in a position to apply for positions elsewhere, including in Europe. “It’s pretty debilitating,” Grishma told <i>Reuters</i>. “I’d like to start work to mitigate the financial damage.”Trump’s decision was not a huge surprise, given his election campaign pledge to put American jobs first.Also read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Politics/4ItpsVUuXrtimX2wLZXlnL/H1B-visa-curbs-India-threatens-US-with-trade-retaliation.html"">H-1B visa curbs—India talks tough, signals it may hit back at US</a>But the executive order he signed, though vague in many areas, has prompted thousands of foreign workers already in the United States or applying for visas to work there to re-think their plans. Companies who send them also face huge uncertainty.The concerns are particularly acute in India, where IT firms like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd are top beneficiaries of the H1B visa programme, using it to send computer engineers to service clients in the United States, their largest overseas market.Companies and staff realignExperts say Trump’s order to review visa processes is aimed at firms like TCS, Infosys and Wipro, which from 2005-14 snagged around 86,000 H1B visas, roughly equivalent to the number of H1B visas the United States issues in total each year.Two industry people aware of the matter said Infosys, India’s no. 2 information technology (IT) services company, is applying for just under 1,000 H1B visas this year, which one of the people said was down from 6,500 applications in 2016 and some 9,000 in 2015.It was not clear whether the sharp reduction in 2017 was in direct response to Trump’s presidency, although the company has said for some time it wanted to cut dependence on “fly-in” staff. TCS, Infosys and Wipro said they would not share data on the number of H1B visas they had applied for this year.With fewer visas going to Infosys, more might become available for smaller IT companies and big US tech companies, like Facebook and Microsoft Corp, that typically send in fewer H1B applications each year.US-based immigration lawyer Murali Bashyam, managing partner of Bashyam Spiro LLP which advises and works with small to mid-sized Indian IT firms, said clients had been in contact seeking clarity, while the number of visa applicants had fallen.“I think the reason for that is they get the sense that it’s going to get so much tougher to comply with all of the changes ... that it might not be worth their money,” he said. “There is a fear that radical immigration changes are coming, and if those radical immigration changes come then it could completely change the way IT staffing companies do business.”Bashyam said the number of people on H1B visas already working in the United States who were considering returning to their home country had risen.An engineer working at Cisco, who has been in the United States since 2011, said that three months ago he would not have considered returning to India. But the review of the visa system, and any rule change that revoked the right for his wife to work in the United States on a dependent visa, could force him to change his mind.“If that happens, then I would definitely be interested in going back to India. Even though I’m secure, I don’t want to be in a situation where my wife cannot work,” said the engineer, who declined to be named. “Those who have heavily invested here, who’ve bought houses, property and are still on visas, are afraid.”‘I’m looking eastward’According to Bashyam, some Indians on H1B visas were cancelling plans to return home to visit their families in case they had problems getting back into the United States. “With everything that’s going on, travelling outside the US is the biggest fear for a lot of the H1B workers working in the IT staffing industry,” he said.And the uncertainty is not limited to IT. Trump’s campaign rhetoric around tighter visa rules has led some Indian students considering studying abroad to look beyond the United States, which typically draws in over 1,00,000 Indian students annually.One Canadian official said the number of student visa applications for certain courses in Canada had spiked over 250% since Trump’s election win in November.Akshay Baliga, a management consultant with a H1B visa that is valid until 2018, said he was not considering returning to the United States for work any time soon. “As a professional I’m looking eastward,” said Baliga, now based in India but who earlier studied and lived for years in America.

-0.25,"New Delhi: The ministry of electronics and IT on Thursday issued guidelines on setting up of IT infrastructure by government departments using cloud computing technology with a clause mandating that all data must be stored within the country. The guidelines for government departments on contractual terms related to cloud services said since the data can be located in one or more discrete sites in foreign countries, therefore, the condition for data location has to be specifically mentioned in the agreement with the service provider. “The terms and conditions of the Empanelment of the Cloud Service Provider has taken care of this requirement by stating that all services including data will be guaranteed to reside in India,” the guidelines said. The cloud computing service enables its user to hire or use software, storage, servers as per requirement instead of purchasing the whole system. Meity has empanelled 11 companies for providing cloud computing services to government departments which include Microsoft Corp., Hewlett Packard, IBM India ,Tata Communications, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), Net Magic IT Services, Sify Technologies and CtrlS Data Centers. Cloud computing can help government departments expand capacity of their IT system as per need and even for short period and quickly start any online service. The cloud computing system can be of help to departments specially in handling sudden load of web traffic generated to access their websites like in case of train ticket booking, form filling or tax submission on a last date etc. “...the department is required to move away from the traditional fixed payment model to a variable pricing / utility pricing model where the department pays for the resources it actually uses during that period. The payment terms have to be structured accordingly to pay only for the resources used by the department,” a separate set of guideline issued for cloud services procurement said. The guidelines on cloud computing follows MeghRaj Policy (cloud policy) to provide strategic direction for adoption of cloud services by the government. The aim of the cloud policy is to realise a comprehensive vision of a government cloud (GI Cloud) environment available for use by central and state government line departments, districts and municipalities to accelerate their ICT-enabled service improvements. As per the guidelines, both cloud service provider (CSP) and government department will have to share responsibility for the managing services provisioned using cloud computing facility.“The CSP’s part in this shared responsibility includes providing its services on a highly secure and controlled platform and providing a wide array of security features customers can use. The departments’ responsibility includes configuring their IT environments in a secure and controlled manner for their purposes,” the guideline said.",2017-04-20,"Meity has empanelled 11 companies for providing cloud computing services to government departments which include Microsoft , IBM India  and  BSNL",competitor,23:13,Govt IT data on cloud system must be stored within India: Meity
-0.35,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"">At first glance, the letter from the Delhi police commissioner’s desk could have easily been dismissed as  another routine laundry list of his department’s “achievements” in the previous year.A closer look at the letter, written a little over two years ago, would have sprung a pleasant surprise in the context of the city police’s technology prowess.The Delhi Police, according to the letter, had partnered with the Indian Space Research Organisation to implement CMAPS—Crime Mapping, Analytics and Predictive System—under the “Effective use of Space Technology-based Tools for Internal Security Scheme” initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014.CMAPS generates crime-reporting queries and has the capacity to identify crime hotspots by auto sweep on the Dial 100 database every 1-3 minutes, replacing a Delhi Police crime-mapping tool that involved manual gathering of data every 15 days. It performs trend analysis, compiles crime and criminal profiles and analyses the behaviour of suspected offenders—all with accompanying graphics. CMAPs also has a security module for VIP threat rating, based on vulnerability of the potential target and the security deployed, and advanced predictive analysis, among other features.A prototype of the standalone version was installed at the Delhi Police control room in June 2015. The software’s statistical models and algorithms today help the police carry out “predictive policing” to forecast where the next crime is likely to occur, much like in cities such as London, Los Angeles, Kent and Berlin.That’s just one example of how technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains.Fintech start-up Lendingkart Technologies has developed tools based on big data analytics to help lenders evaluate borrowers’ creditworthiness. Using these tools, its sister company Lendingkart Finance Ltd aims to transform small business lending by providing easy access to credit for small and medium enterprises.The “technology platform has helped create a highly operational efficiency model that enables swift loan disbursement within 72 hours of loan application. Over 120,000 SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) have till date reached out to Lendingkart Finance for their credit needs,” the company said.Accenture Labs and Akshaya Patra, the world’s largest NGO-run midday meal programme, said on Thursday that they had partnered in a project to “exponentially increase the number of meals served to children in schools in India that are run and aided by the government”.Using “disruptive technology”, they hope to potentially “improve efficiency by 20%, which could boost the number of meals served by millions”.Accenture Labs began the project with a “strategic assessment and design thinking, then developed a prototype for improving kitchen operations and outcomes”. An example of Akshaya Patra’s transformation, according to Thursday’s statement, was its move “from manual collection of feedback from children and schools to a more efficient technology-based solution” that involved the use of blockchain (the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin) and sensor-enabled devices to gather feedback digitally, and use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to “predict the next day’s meal requirements”. Consider another example. Until even early 2015, the thousands of distributors of consumer goods firm Marico Ltd in Mumbai used to place orders and wait “almost a day” before getting the goods delivered. Now it takes just 10-15 minutes for an order to be delivered, helping them stock fewer goods. In turn, the lower inventory helps them cut down on warehouse space and pare costs, besides reducing the waiting time for trucks. All these distributors have benefited from <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/PkjAud0lcXFc2H9egy0JQP/Marico-taps-analytics-for-growth.html"" target=""_blank"">an analytics-driven Order Management Execution System that the company launched in December 2014</a>.Big Data and the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) are intimately connected: billions of Internet-connected “things” will, by definition, generate massive amounts of data. By 2020, the world would have generated around 40 zettabytes of data, or 5,127 gigabytes per individual, according to an estimate by research firm International Data Corp. It’s no wonder that in 2006, market researcher Clive Humby declared data to be “the new oil”. Companies are sharpening their focus on analysing this deluge of data to understand consumer behaviour patterns. A report by software body Nasscom and Blueocean Market Intelligence, a global analytics and insight provider, predicts that the Indian analytics market will cross the $2 billion mark by this fiscal year.Companies are using Big Data analytics for everything—driving growth, reducing costs, improving operations and recruiting better people.A major portion of orders of e-commerce firms now come through their analytics-driven systems. These firms record the purchasing behaviour of buyers and customize things for them. Travel firms, on their part, use data analytics to understand their customers—from basic things like their travel patterns, the kind of hotels they like to stay in, who their typical co-travellers are, their experiences—all geared to giving the customer a personalized experience the next time the customer visits the website.In hospitals, intelligence derived from data helps improve patient care through quicker and more accurate diagnoses, drug dosage recommendations and the prediction of potential side effects. Millions of electronic medical records, public health data and claims records are being analysed.Predictive healthcare using wearables to check vital medical signs and remote diagnostics could cut patient waiting times, according to a 13 January report by the McKinsey Global Institute. International Business Machines Corp.’s Watson, a cluster of computers that combines artificial intelligence and advanced analytics software and works as a “question answering” system, is being used for a variety of applications, most notably in oncology, the branch of medicine that deals with cancer. Watson for Oncology helps physicians quickly identify key information in a patient’s medical records, sift through tons of data and come up with most optimal medical choices.Many companies globally and in India, including some start-ups, are using machine-learning tools to infuse intelligence in their business by using predictive models. Popular machine-learning applications include Google’s self-driving car, online recommendations from e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Flipkart, online dating service Tinder and streaming video platform Netflix. Railigent, Siemens AG’s platform for the predictive maintenance for trains, listens to the trains running over its sensors and can detect, from the sound of the wheels, which wheel is broken and when it should be replaced.Predictive algorithms are used in recruitment too. Aspiring Minds, for instance, uses algorithms powered by machine learning that draw on data to address complex issues—for instance, to accurately gauge the quality of speech in various accents against a neutral accent (also using natural language processing). This helps companies improve recruitment efficiency by over 35% and reduce voice evaluation costs by 55%.Artificial intelligence, machine-learning-based algorithms and anomaly-detection techniques will need to be used to monitor activity across networks and real-time data streams, consulting firms point out. These technologies will, for instance, let banks in India identify threats as they occur while maintaining low false positive alarm rates even for new types of threats.There are still challenges in bringing about wider technology adoption.“Our survey showed that only about 4% of companies across industries have the capabilities to use advanced data analytics to deliver tangible business value. While some oil and gas companies have invested in their analytics capabilities, many struggle to get their arms around this powerful new opportunity,” said a March 2014 note by Bain and Co..“We often find that senior executives understand the concepts around Big Data and advanced analytics, but their teams have difficulty defining the path to value creation and the implications for technology strategy, operating model and organization. Too often, companies delegate the task of capturing value from better analytics to the IT department, as a technology project,” the note pointed out.In the 2006 movie <i>Deja Vu</i>, law enforcement agents investigate an explosion on a ferry that kills over 500 people, including a large group of party-going sailors. They use a new program that uses satellite technology to look back in time for four-and-a-half days—to try to capture the terrorist.Predictive policing is surely not as advanced today. And advances in predictive analytics can certainly raise ethical issues. For instance, the police may in the future be able to predict who might become a serial offender, and make an intervention at an early stage to change the path followed by the person, as is the case in <i>Deja Vu</i>. Or an insurance firm may use predictions to increase the premium or even deny a user an insurance.Any disruptive technology needs checks and balances in the form of good policy if it is to deliver to its potential.",2017-05-02,"Technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains",competitor,22:20,Making predictions with Big Data

Now, an analyst at a foreign brokerage has suggested that the company is better off without the target.ALSO READ: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Money/JbzPzyPMJdV4ZBhqSyxkbK/Has-Infosyss-recovery-dissipated-before-it-even-started.html"" target=""_blank"">Has Infosys’s recovery dissipated before it even started?</a>“Management continues to maintain ‘aspirational’ revenue and margin targets that are increasingly becoming unlikely to be achieved, in our opinion. Given Infy (Infosys) is now guiding to lower levels of both revenue growth and margins in FY18 (2017-18), we think management would be well-served to either amend or drop its aspirational targets,” Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 April. Based on its <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/hI2j9yckPHHX6PkEuKU2PK/Infosys-Q4-earnings-subdued-guidance-lower-for-201718.html"" target=""_blank"">guidance for 2017-18</a>, issued last week, Infosys expects to end the year with revenue of between $10.8 billion and $11.3 billion. Infosys maintains this target is an ambition and the management has no plans to dump it.In April 2015, Infosys first outlined its ambitious target: India’s second largest software firm wanted to become a $20 billion firm with 30% operating margin and to generate $80,000 in revenue from every employee working on a project.  In 2016, it tweaked the deadline to 2020-21. Infosys ended financial year 2015 with $8.7 billion in revenue, 25.9% in operating margin and generated $52,300 per employee.Two years later, Infosys managed a compound annual growth rate of 8.25% to increase its revenue to $10.21 billion but operating margin declined by 120 basis points to 24.7% and revenue per employee slipped to $51,400, making many question CEO Vishal Sikka’s strategy.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Not that Sikka hasn’t delivered. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17;  for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been  the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the “impossible targets.” “The industry is going through a structural change, and to make it worse, you set yourself impossible targets,” said a former EVP, who quit last year. “A large component of a senior executive’s salary is tied to company’s annual growth, which itself is linked to the long-term target.”Infosys says it outlined a target to make its employees work towards a goal and eventually help script a turnaround.“We gave this target because we believed this would help motivate employees, and help the CEO make them work towards a goal,” one board member, who was part of the goal-setting exercise, said on  condition of anonymity. “Looking back, I’m still not sure if it was a wrong step. I’m still on the fence,  thinking how and what we could have done better to make sure hopes did not run high and employees did not come under pressure.”One of the things Infosys could have avoided was linking Sikka’s salary to the target, said the second executive who quit, a former SVP. This seemed to suggest that  this was much more than an aspirational target, as the CEO himself has repeatedly said. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/nZzaphFLFUOqP1EuegR9EL/Infosys-CEO-Vishal-Sikka-takes-home-only-61-of-eligible-pay.html"" target=""_blank"">A weak performance in this year hurt Sikka</a>, who earned $6.8 million in 2016-17, less than the $7.3 million he earned in 2015-16. Sikka got $3.8 million of the promised $8 million performance-related pay, despite a clause in his employment contract that guaranteed him at least 90% of his $11 million salary (including bonuses). It is a general practice for companies to have long-term goals. Wipro, under Abidali Neemuchwala, has outlined an ambition to become $15 billion firm with a 23% margin by March 2020.

-0.61,"Mumbai: For Grishma, an Indian software designer, President Donald Trump’s review of the visa programme for bringing highly skilled workers into the United States comes at a bad time.Fresh from gaining a master’s degree in Europe, and with an offer of employment from a well-known US design firm, she was well on her way to fulfilling the ambition of many young Indian IT workers—a dream job in America.But as she waits in the H1B visa queue for the green light, she is caught in a bind. “It’s a weird time to be applying, with all the scrutiny,” said Grishma, who gave only her first name for fear of jeopardising her chances of getting a visa.The United States has already suspended the “expedited processing option” for applicants, under which she may have received a visa in weeks. More broadly, uncertainty over the review announced this week has unsettled Grishma and many others like her.She will have to wait until at least around August to learn her fate, but having accepted the US job offer she is not in a position to apply for positions elsewhere, including in Europe. “It’s pretty debilitating,” Grishma told <i>Reuters</i>. “I’d like to start work to mitigate the financial damage.”Trump’s decision was not a huge surprise, given his election campaign pledge to put American jobs first.Also read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Politics/4ItpsVUuXrtimX2wLZXlnL/H1B-visa-curbs-India-threatens-US-with-trade-retaliation.html"">H-1B visa curbs—India talks tough, signals it may hit back at US</a>But the executive order he signed, though vague in many areas, has prompted thousands of foreign workers already in the United States or applying for visas to work there to re-think their plans. Companies who send them also face huge uncertainty.The concerns are particularly acute in India, where IT firms like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd are top beneficiaries of the H1B visa programme, using it to send computer engineers to service clients in the United States, their largest overseas market.Companies and staff realignExperts say Trump’s order to review visa processes is aimed at firms like TCS, Infosys and Wipro, which from 2005-14 snagged around 86,000 H1B visas, roughly equivalent to the number of H1B visas the United States issues in total each year.Two industry people aware of the matter said Infosys, India’s no. 2 information technology (IT) services company, is applying for just under 1,000 H1B visas this year, which one of the people said was down from 6,500 applications in 2016 and some 9,000 in 2015.It was not clear whether the sharp reduction in 2017 was in direct response to Trump’s presidency, although the company has said for some time it wanted to cut dependence on “fly-in” staff. TCS, Infosys and Wipro said they would not share data on the number of H1B visas they had applied for this year.With fewer visas going to Infosys, more might become available for smaller IT companies and big US tech companies, like Facebook and Microsoft Corp, that typically send in fewer H1B applications each year.US-based immigration lawyer Murali Bashyam, managing partner of Bashyam Spiro LLP which advises and works with small to mid-sized Indian IT firms, said clients had been in contact seeking clarity, while the number of visa applicants had fallen.“I think the reason for that is they get the sense that it’s going to get so much tougher to comply with all of the changes ... that it might not be worth their money,” he said. “There is a fear that radical immigration changes are coming, and if those radical immigration changes come then it could completely change the way IT staffing companies do business.”Bashyam said the number of people on H1B visas already working in the United States who were considering returning to their home country had risen.An engineer working at Cisco, who has been in the United States since 2011, said that three months ago he would not have considered returning to India. But the review of the visa system, and any rule change that revoked the right for his wife to work in the United States on a dependent visa, could force him to change his mind.“If that happens, then I would definitely be interested in going back to India. Even though I’m secure, I don’t want to be in a situation where my wife cannot work,” said the engineer, who declined to be named. “Those who have heavily invested here, who’ve bought houses, property and are still on visas, are afraid.”‘I’m looking eastward’According to Bashyam, some Indians on H1B visas were cancelling plans to return home to visit their families in case they had problems getting back into the United States. “With everything that’s going on, travelling outside the US is the biggest fear for a lot of the H1B workers working in the IT staffing industry,” he said.And the uncertainty is not limited to IT. Trump’s campaign rhetoric around tighter visa rules has led some Indian students considering studying abroad to look beyond the United States, which typically draws in over 1,00,000 Indian students annually.One Canadian official said the number of student visa applications for certain courses in Canada had spiked over 250% since Trump’s election win in November.Akshay Baliga, a management consultant with a H1B visa that is valid until 2018, said he was not considering returning to the United States for work any time soon. “As a professional I’m looking eastward,” said Baliga, now based in India but who earlier studied and lived for years in America.

0.68,"Washington: Unfazed by the possible changes to the H1B visa regime, chief executive officer (CEO) of India’s IT major TCS,  Rajesh Gopinathan has said the current discourse on the issue in the US is driven by emotions rather than economy and the best way to tackle it is through greater engagement. Gopinathan favoured a policy of engagement with various stake holders on the issue of H1B visas in the US. He noted that the discourse is currently driven by emotions rather than economy. “The best way to tackle that is greater engagement. Because the way, sometimes, companies like us get characterised is very different from the reality of what we bring to the table,” Gopinathan, who is in his mid-40s, said. “Some of these engagements actually help get that message out also. People will understand us better for who we are, and I think engagement, communication and collaboration is the best way to deal with the political lack of understanding which comes. Democracy ought to deal with the emotional response that you see and you have to get over it and engage positively,” Gopinathan said. He said the US has been a “very welcoming market” for the IT major and has provided it with a fair, open and competitive environment. “All said and done, the US has been a very welcoming market for us. So you keep aside the immediate issues, it’s been a market that has been fair, it has been an open, competitive environment,” Gopinathan told <i>PTI,</i> exuding confidence that TCS would be able to successfully compete in any environment. Gopinathan said TCS has competed and has won against the best in the country. “We have competed and we have won against the global best in this country, on equal footing. So, it has been a market that has helped us grow in confidence as we have gone,” he said but repeatedly refrained from having any complaint from the present system or the possibility of a new executive order that would adversely have an impact on his company’s performance due to any action by the Trump Administration on H1B visas. US President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order that would tighten the process of issuing the H1B visas and seek a review of the system for creating an “entirely new structure” for awarding these visas. Gopinathan was appointed as the new CEO of TCS this January after his predecessor N. Chandrasekaran was elevated to the post of chairman of Tata Sons. Responding to questions on a potential executive order or legislations being talked about by lawmakers, Gopinathan asserted that there is no law currently in the US that is discriminatory. “There are many that are being discussed, which if they were to get passed, in their extreme form would be discriminatory. So we should actually give credence to the system here, that is, as I said, it is fair. It has been fair in the past, there is no reason for us to assume that it will not be fair in the future. So, let’s deal with what’s on the ground and let’s go step by step,” he said. “More importantly, we have very active STEM education engagement in the US. We work with colleges, high school students, we reach out, we have touched close to 20,000 plus students already, and significantly we are accelerate that into what we call Ignite My Future Campaign. We just target to touch one million students all in the next five years,” he said. Noting that the technology market is actually under supplied, he said the sheer demand of technical skills far outstrips the supply. “What we’ve been successful in India is to actually increase the world supply, often generating graduates way beyond what the governing systems actually provided. So we capitalised the emergence of a private sector education complex that served to provide us the talent required for our growth,” he said.

The stock has surged 128% since 1 January, beating returns from rivals such as billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla-controlled Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltd and Tata group’s Trent Ltd.A shortage of cash hit purchases of soaps to cars after Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November junked high-value currency bills, driving shoppers to large-format stores like Future Retail that accept credit cards. Sales may jump 25% this year as the company adds to its chain of 1,000-plus stores, India’s biggest, group chief executive officer Kishore Biyani said in an interview.“Demonetisation was one big tailwind in recent months and the single goods-and-services tax will be the next big push,” said Himanshu Nayyar, Mumbai-based analyst at Systematix Shares &amp; Stocks Ltd, referring to the sales tax regime that will help retailers buy materials seamlessly from across states after it is rolled out from 1 July.

Revenue jumped almost fourfold to Rs12,600 crore, according to its website. The turnaround isn’t just because of Modi’s currency policy change.In recent years, the company has exited non-core businesses and hived off its supply chain infrastructure to a group firm as part of efforts to lower debt.

-0.35,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"">At first glance, the letter from the Delhi police commissioner’s desk could have easily been dismissed as  another routine laundry list of his department’s “achievements” in the previous year.A closer look at the letter, written a little over two years ago, would have sprung a pleasant surprise in the context of the city police’s technology prowess.The Delhi Police, according to the letter, had partnered with the Indian Space Research Organisation to implement CMAPS—Crime Mapping, Analytics and Predictive System—under the “Effective use of Space Technology-based Tools for Internal Security Scheme” initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014.CMAPS generates crime-reporting queries and has the capacity to identify crime hotspots by auto sweep on the Dial 100 database every 1-3 minutes, replacing a Delhi Police crime-mapping tool that involved manual gathering of data every 15 days. It performs trend analysis, compiles crime and criminal profiles and analyses the behaviour of suspected offenders—all with accompanying graphics. CMAPs also has a security module for VIP threat rating, based on vulnerability of the potential target and the security deployed, and advanced predictive analysis, among other features.A prototype of the standalone version was installed at the Delhi Police control room in June 2015. The software’s statistical models and algorithms today help the police carry out “predictive policing” to forecast where the next crime is likely to occur, much like in cities such as London, Los Angeles, Kent and Berlin.That’s just one example of how technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains.Fintech start-up Lendingkart Technologies has developed tools based on big data analytics to help lenders evaluate borrowers’ creditworthiness. Using these tools, its sister company Lendingkart Finance Ltd aims to transform small business lending by providing easy access to credit for small and medium enterprises.The “technology platform has helped create a highly operational efficiency model that enables swift loan disbursement within 72 hours of loan application. Over 120,000 SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) have till date reached out to Lendingkart Finance for their credit needs,” the company said.Accenture Labs and Akshaya Patra, the world’s largest NGO-run midday meal programme, said on Thursday that they had partnered in a project to “exponentially increase the number of meals served to children in schools in India that are run and aided by the government”.Using “disruptive technology”, they hope to potentially “improve efficiency by 20%, which could boost the number of meals served by millions”.Accenture Labs began the project with a “strategic assessment and design thinking, then developed a prototype for improving kitchen operations and outcomes”. An example of Akshaya Patra’s transformation, according to Thursday’s statement, was its move “from manual collection of feedback from children and schools to a more efficient technology-based solution” that involved the use of blockchain (the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin) and sensor-enabled devices to gather feedback digitally, and use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to “predict the next day’s meal requirements”. Consider another example. Until even early 2015, the thousands of distributors of consumer goods firm Marico Ltd in Mumbai used to place orders and wait “almost a day” before getting the goods delivered. Now it takes just 10-15 minutes for an order to be delivered, helping them stock fewer goods. In turn, the lower inventory helps them cut down on warehouse space and pare costs, besides reducing the waiting time for trucks. All these distributors have benefited from <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/PkjAud0lcXFc2H9egy0JQP/Marico-taps-analytics-for-growth.html"" target=""_blank"">an analytics-driven Order Management Execution System that the company launched in December 2014</a>.Big Data and the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) are intimately connected: billions of Internet-connected “things” will, by definition, generate massive amounts of data. By 2020, the world would have generated around 40 zettabytes of data, or 5,127 gigabytes per individual, according to an estimate by research firm International Data Corp. It’s no wonder that in 2006, market researcher Clive Humby declared data to be “the new oil”. Companies are sharpening their focus on analysing this deluge of data to understand consumer behaviour patterns. A report by software body Nasscom and Blueocean Market Intelligence, a global analytics and insight provider, predicts that the Indian analytics market will cross the $2 billion mark by this fiscal year.Companies are using Big Data analytics for everything—driving growth, reducing costs, improving operations and recruiting better people.A major portion of orders of e-commerce firms now come through their analytics-driven systems. These firms record the purchasing behaviour of buyers and customize things for them. Travel firms, on their part, use data analytics to understand their customers—from basic things like their travel patterns, the kind of hotels they like to stay in, who their typical co-travellers are, their experiences—all geared to giving the customer a personalized experience the next time the customer visits the website.In hospitals, intelligence derived from data helps improve patient care through quicker and more accurate diagnoses, drug dosage recommendations and the prediction of potential side effects. Millions of electronic medical records, public health data and claims records are being analysed.Predictive healthcare using wearables to check vital medical signs and remote diagnostics could cut patient waiting times, according to a 13 January report by the McKinsey Global Institute. International Business Machines Corp.’s Watson, a cluster of computers that combines artificial intelligence and advanced analytics software and works as a “question answering” system, is being used for a variety of applications, most notably in oncology, the branch of medicine that deals with cancer. Watson for Oncology helps physicians quickly identify key information in a patient’s medical records, sift through tons of data and come up with most optimal medical choices.Many companies globally and in India, including some start-ups, are using machine-learning tools to infuse intelligence in their business by using predictive models. Popular machine-learning applications include Google’s self-driving car, online recommendations from e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Flipkart, online dating service Tinder and streaming video platform Netflix. Railigent, Siemens AG’s platform for the predictive maintenance for trains, listens to the trains running over its sensors and can detect, from the sound of the wheels, which wheel is broken and when it should be replaced.Predictive algorithms are used in recruitment too. Aspiring Minds, for instance, uses algorithms powered by machine learning that draw on data to address complex issues—for instance, to accurately gauge the quality of speech in various accents against a neutral accent (also using natural language processing). This helps companies improve recruitment efficiency by over 35% and reduce voice evaluation costs by 55%.Artificial intelligence, machine-learning-based algorithms and anomaly-detection techniques will need to be used to monitor activity across networks and real-time data streams, consulting firms point out. These technologies will, for instance, let banks in India identify threats as they occur while maintaining low false positive alarm rates even for new types of threats.There are still challenges in bringing about wider technology adoption.“Our survey showed that only about 4% of companies across industries have the capabilities to use advanced data analytics to deliver tangible business value. While some oil and gas companies have invested in their analytics capabilities, many struggle to get their arms around this powerful new opportunity,” said a March 2014 note by Bain and Co..“We often find that senior executives understand the concepts around Big Data and advanced analytics, but their teams have difficulty defining the path to value creation and the implications for technology strategy, operating model and organization. Too often, companies delegate the task of capturing value from better analytics to the IT department, as a technology project,” the note pointed out.In the 2006 movie <i>Deja Vu</i>, law enforcement agents investigate an explosion on a ferry that kills over 500 people, including a large group of party-going sailors. They use a new program that uses satellite technology to look back in time for four-and-a-half days—to try to capture the terrorist.Predictive policing is surely not as advanced today. And advances in predictive analytics can certainly raise ethical issues. For instance, the police may in the future be able to predict who might become a serial offender, and make an intervention at an early stage to change the path followed by the person, as is the case in <i>Deja Vu</i>. Or an insurance firm may use predictions to increase the premium or even deny a user an insurance.Any disruptive technology needs checks and balances in the form of good policy if it is to deliver to its potential.",2017-05-02,"Technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains",competitor,22:20,Making predictions with Big Data

Infosys maintains this target is an ambition and the management has no plans to dump it.In April 2015, Infosys first outlined its ambitious target: India’s second largest software firm wanted to become a $20 billion firm with 30% operating margin and to generate $80,000 in revenue from every employee working on a project.  In 2016, it tweaked the deadline to 2020-21. Infosys ended financial year 2015 with $8.7 billion in revenue, 25.9% in operating margin and generated $52,300 per employee.Two years later, Infosys managed a compound annual growth rate of 8.25% to increase its revenue to $10.21 billion but operating margin declined by 120 basis points to 24.7% and revenue per employee slipped to $51,400, making many question CEO Vishal Sikka’s strategy.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Not that Sikka hasn’t delivered. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17;  for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been  the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the “impossible targets.” “The industry is going through a structural change, and to make it worse, you set yourself impossible targets,” said a former EVP, who quit last year. “A large component of a senior executive’s salary is tied to company’s annual growth, which itself is linked to the long-term target.”Infosys says it outlined a target to make its employees work towards a goal and eventually help script a turnaround.“We gave this target because we believed this would help motivate employees, and help the CEO make them work towards a goal,” one board member, who was part of the goal-setting exercise, said on  condition of anonymity. “Looking back, I’m still not sure if it was a wrong step. I’m still on the fence,  thinking how and what we could have done better to make sure hopes did not run high and employees did not come under pressure.”One of the things Infosys could have avoided was linking Sikka’s salary to the target, said the second executive who quit, a former SVP. This seemed to suggest that  this was much more than an aspirational target, as the CEO himself has repeatedly said. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/nZzaphFLFUOqP1EuegR9EL/Infosys-CEO-Vishal-Sikka-takes-home-only-61-of-eligible-pay.html"" target=""_blank"">A weak performance in this year hurt Sikka</a>, who earned $6.8 million in 2016-17, less than the $7.3 million he earned in 2015-16. Sikka got $3.8 million of the promised $8 million performance-related pay, despite a clause in his employment contract that guaranteed him at least 90% of his $11 million salary (including bonuses).

The volume of daily cashless transactions has increased from Rs150 crore to Rs400 crore per day since the 8 November demonetization of high-value banknotes that created a cash crunch.So far, 38,128 retail outlets have been equipped with point-of-sale (PoS) machines. More than 86% of the outlets have infrastructure for digital payment transactions. “Most of the petrol pumps have opted for digital infrastructure such as micro ATMs and e-wallets since demonetization. However, the cashless drive can be accelerated further with the adoption of BharatQR or a standardized quick response (QR) code across all the retail outlets,” said Sunil Kulkarni, deputy managing director, Oxigen Services (India) Pvt.

-0.52,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is seeking to step up the pace of auctioning power-purchase contracts for wind-energy plants, building on a contest that reaped record-low prices for solar farms earlier this month.The government plans to offer deals covering almost 4 gigawatts of wind capacity in the current fiscal year ending March 2018 in addition to 750 megawatts of solar capacity it will tender next month, Ashvini Kumar, managing director at Solar Energy Corp. of India, the country’s implementing agency for renewable targets, told reporters in New Delhi.Modi is seeking to expand renewables to help balance India’s burgeoning needs for electricity against efforts to clear the skies of pollution. The government has a goal to install 175 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2022 and is prodding local authorities to step up the pace of permitting renewables.“The ministry of new and renewable energy has written to all states to indicate their requirement for green power to consolidate demand, as more tenders would be brought out,” Kumar said.SECI, which conducted Asia’s first onshore wind auction in February, received bids to supply wind power for Rs3.46 (5 US cents) a kilowatt-hour, much lower than feed-in tariffs of Rs4 rupees to Rs5 prevailing across India’s most windy states.Also Read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/m83GjZAfpnMj2T0sMQNhpJ/Green-energy-firms-explore-portfolio-mergers-to-aid-selloff.html"" target=""_blank"">Green energy firms explore portfolio mergers to aid sell-off</a>According to Kumar, the government thinks that 5 gigawatts to 6 gigawatts of wind capacity can be added every fiscal, and companies could be able to reach the government’s goal over the next four years.Modi’s goal calls for a doubling of India’s wind capacity to 60 gigawatts and a 10-fold increase in solar projects to 100 gigawatts.SECI already has planned to offer 750 megawatts of solar projects next month in the sunny state of Rajasthan, anticipating that contest will bring record-low bids. The auction structure forces companies to compete for contracts to sell power from renewable energy plants, encouraging them to reduce prices.The price of solar power in India fell to a record of Rs3.15 a kilowatt-hour last week in an auction for 250 megawatts earlier this month, besting February’s record of Rs3.30 a unit.“The trend in the market should continue, and I would like to think that the market hasn’t bottomed out,” Kumar said when asked if tariffs in the upcoming project could go below the Rs3 mark.Also Read:<a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/Q5Florefv9lbFwnMQhsXpO/Foreign-investors-giving-MA-deals-in-Indias-renewable-ener.html"" target=""_blank""> Foreign investors giving M&amp;A deals in India’s renewable energy sector a miss</a>Timely payments to investors backing green power also will help bring prices lower, the official said.

The firms bidding included companies from the Middle East and other locations new to India’s renewables auctions.Infrastructure development and finance group IL&amp;FS has developed the 500-megawatt solar park by acquiring land for installations and building power evacuation systems, while the same has been done for the remaining 250-megawatt portion by Indian conglomerate Adani group.The solar park charges for the IL&amp;FS group facility are Rs0.42 crore a megawatt, while that for the Adani group’s park are Rs0.36 crore, SECI General Manager Sanjay Sharma said.

Edited excerpts: <p class=""question"">You have kind of relinquished your position as CEO in Nissan and are going to be focusing on the alliance specific to Mitsubishi. In India, Mitsubishi’s problem was no scale, no investment and no appropriate product. Suddenly these problems matter no more because of the alliance. Will it be logical to assume that with the alliance there’s a big market out there for Mitsubishi to tap? Without any doubt because, in India, the most important step and our key for success—not sufficient but necessary—is the product.  If you don’t have the product, you better not try your chance in India. It takes a lot of time to find a product. I think, with the A-platform (the second of the so-called common module family, or CMF, jointly developed by Renault and Nissan, a sort of modular manufacturing system for cars),  particularly with the Kwid and all the products that are going to follow that, we think we have found our entry level (car) in the Indian market. But this platform is an alliance platform. Today, you are having a Renault product, tomorrow you are going to have a Nissan product. This platform will be open to Mitsubishi. <p class=""question"">So Mitsubishi could use it and you could go all the way up and bring the Lancer back for example? Yes, but Mitsubishi has so many opportunities to grow that the management of Mitsubishi is going to have to prioritize what they are going to do first, second and third. So I cannot tell you in what time frame this will happen, but without any doubt, this is a very big market for (the) future for any carmaker and for Mitsubishi in particular.<p class=""question"">So what you are confirming is that it’s not a question of if but a question of when Mitsubishi will come to India with all guns blazing? We are not limited to the short term; it is going to obviously mean mid- or long-term. Everybody expects India to be in the top 3-4 markets in the future. So you can expect that what happened in China, where all the carmakers are present, is also going to happen in India, with (the) exception that the Indian market is very tough for the foreign carmaker because of the specificity of the product and market.<p class=""question"">Do you think you have an edge with Kwid? It is doing well and has already got a lot of things like design and the touch-screen and a lot of things.Yes, we do; and we are improving and we are listening to what the customers are saying in India. Not only to improve our offer for the Kwid in India but also to improve our offer for the Kwid outside India because you know a version of the Kwid is going to be launched in Brazil as a second step of the A platform. So, for the Indian market, this is very important because it is very competitive, and if you are going to make it in India, you are going to make it in many emerging markets, and that’s why for us, testing and being successful in India and having a very strong acceptance of the product, a very competitive product in India, is a guarantee that these are going to do well in other markets.<p class=""question"">Are you making money in India? Is this the tipping point?We are starting to make money now after selling 100,000 Kwids. We struggled at the beginning because it was the new plant and a new car, so when you have so much innovation accommodated, you struggle with profitability. When you are going to a new emerging market with a new product, you have to be patient for your returns. <p class=""question"">In future, is the CMF-B (for cars slightly larger than those on the CMF-A platform) also expected?Obviously, the volume you expect from a car based on that platform is not going to be very big, so it can be an additional product but you can’t have a strategy on this platform.<p class=""question"">So is there a lesson learnt by Nissan on the performance of its V platform (cars such as the Sunny and Micra that did not do well in India)? That you fundamentally cannot bring a European platform into India because the cost is too high and the customers may not pay for it? You can bring copy and paste platform and product but that has to be a niche product. Don’t expect big volume coming out of it. If you want big volume in India and contribute to the core market, you will have to really tailor it, even the platform.<p class=""question"">On Renault’s strategy, you are selling around 10,000 vehicles every month and are the No.1 European carmaker in India. You’ve even rattled Suzuki. So, that is saying something. What is the aim? Were you expecting this level of success?I think this is all due to the attractiveness of the product. I think we have some improvement that we can make in terms of competitiveness of our plant because the plants are filled, then we have much better industrial performance, but we are not there. We will have a lot of improvement that we can make into this plant. Yes, after we have seen that the CMF-A and the CMF-A+ platforms are really adequately addressing the needs of the Indian market, we should be much more ambitions, in terms of contribution.<p class=""question"">You previously mentioned Tata Motors’ Nano is really an inspiration for the Kwid. What are your thoughts on that and Ratan Tata’s vision for the Nano. When Ratan came with the Nano, I congratulated him and he said I was the only one who congratulated him because a lot of people said it’s a bad idea. No, it’s a good idea.

-0.59,"The Indian market looks expensive at current levels, according to Sanjeev Prasad , senior executive director and co-head of Kotak Institutional Equities. In a telephone interview, Prasad said  the best of India’s macroeconomic scenario was behind us, but earnings could  see a significant improvement going ahead, due to a very low base for sectors like banking and commodities. Edited excerpts: How do you view the Indian market at this point of time, with benchmark indices at two-year highs? Do you think there is froth building up, or is there value in the market?It is not a cheap market. If we get 5-6% returns from here for the rest of 2017 for the frontline indices, we should be happy. The mid-cap and small-cap space, however, is very expensive. We may find one or two names here and there, but largely, they are pricey.Most parts of the market are quite fully valued. In some cases such as consumer staple and discretionary sectors, they are even discounting fiscal year 2019 earnings. There is value only in parts of the market.There is value in a few sectors such as corporate banks and IT service companies, assuming potential positive developments in those sectors. For example, the corporate-focused banking sector could see a re-rating if there is some resolution on the NPL (non-performing loans) problem. Similarly, IT stocks are inexpensive given the market’s concerns regarding immigration and taxation issues in the US. If these issues play out with limited impact for the IT companies, the sector could see a re-rating. What is your take on the pharmaceutical sector at this point of time?There is some value selectively in stocks such as Cipla Ltd, Aurobindo Pharma Ltd... Aurobindo is cheap at 13 times FY19 P/E (price-to-earnings ratio). Cipla is also at 16.5 times FY19 earnings. Even Lupin is not looking too bad at 17.5 times FY19 earnings. The issue with this sector at large is that there is a fair amount of uncertainty on the pricing environment in the US. The uncertain pricing environment stems not so much from regulatory-led pricing challenges as market-led pricing challenges.In many of the generic products or segments where these companies operate, they have started to see a lot more competition. Clearly,  profitability which had been very high on these molecules has and will start coming down. At the same time, because of the US FDA-related issues, these companies have not been able to introduce new molecules in their ANDA (abbreviated new drug application) pipelines in the US market. The current portfolio has started to see price erosion, and introduction of new products has got delayed at the same time. When do we see a significant recovery in corporate earnings?The funny thing about India’s earnings is that when we look at the top 50-100 large cap names, a disproportionately high share comes from global sectors such as IT and pharma, global commodity sectors and regulated sectors such as power utilities. So, irrespective of level of activity in the domestic economy, the earnings numbers can move in a different fashion. That has exactly what has happened over the last two-three years. Since early 2015, we have seen a very big improvement in India’s macroeconomic parameters—Inflation came down significantly and current account deficit has also declined sharply. However, earnings growth  between FY14 and FY16 has been flat, if you look at Nifty-50 companies. One of the reasons for this was the collapse of global commodity prices – oil and metals, which hurt the earnings of upstream oil companies and metal producers. Also, we saw a slowdown in earnings for IT companies, and we also had company-specific USFDA issues affecting the profits of the pharma companies.Lastly, while banking should have done better with the economy improving, we had the problems of bad loans in the banking sector, which relates to the rapid expansion in wholesale credit in the last economic cycle. That is the dichotomy of India’s economy and earnings.Going forward, I do not see much of improvement in India’s macroeconomic parameters from where we are. Inflation has bottomed out, and will go higher from here to about 4-5%. If you look at interest rates, they have bottomed out too. Current account deficit may gradually widen, but may still be manageable. However, we could potentially see a big jump in earnings numbers and the reason for that is the very low base for sectors such as the banking and commodities. We expect credit costs for the banks to decline from 2HFY18, which will result in higher profits of the corporate banks. Also, the improvement in global commodity prices and implementation of anti-dumping duties on steel will lead to a sharp increase in the profits of the upstream oil &amp; gas companies and the metals sector in FY18.What is your take on GDP numbers that came out last week? The issue is that the proxies that are used to make these estimates are largely from the formal sectors. It is not very clear how much of the impact on the informal sectors is captured in this data. So, it is possible that once more data points come out, we will a have more informed view on the third-quarter GDP data and we may even see some downward revision to the current numbers. However, it appears that the impact of demonetisation is not as high as was originally feared by the market.In recent times, we have seen the Tata–Mistry spat and some issues also spiking up at Infosys Ltd between founders and the management. What impact do you think such instances can have on the reputation of Indian companies?I would not want to comment on specific companies, but I think as a general fact, there may be challenges when there is a generational change in a way. Most of the Indian companies have founder-promoters or very long-serving professional managers who play a huge role in building the company and more importantly, the culture of the firm. The firm gets largely identified with the founder-promoter or with the professional manager, and these individuals typically have a very dominant influence on their companies. Some of the companies have put in a proper succession plan while some others have been somewhat lagging on this aspect. I would think a proper succession plan under which the successor is identified early enough and works with the incumbent for a longish period will address the issue of any discontinuity and discord. Finally, the boards of companies have to play a far bigger role in ensuring a smooth transition of power.How viable is it to run the telecom business in India?I think the telecom business model has changed dramatically in that companies will have to offer much higher data capacity to the customers, which can meet all the telecom requirements of the customer. Companies will have to work out the ARPUs  (average revenue per user) that can financially support a much higher capacity usage by customers. The traditional model of pricing every service individually to the customer is dead. What Reliance Jio is trying to do is to up the game in terms of offering a lot of capacity to customers at a competitive ARPU, which makes sense to it based on its business plan and strategy. There is a paradigm shift that is happening in the telecom sector in that it will entail much higher investment by the companies in data capacity.",2017-03-08,"Irrespective of the level of activity in the domestic economy, the earnings numbers can move in a different fashion, says Kotak Institutional Equities’s Sanjeev Prasad",competitor,07:57,"Indian market expensive currently, value in corporate banks, IT: Sanjeev Prasad"

-0.25,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"">Infosys Ltd’s promoters continue to be unhappy with some decisions made by the board of India’s second largest software services company. A majority of the promoters did not vote for a resolution seeking a salary increase for chief operating officer U.B. Pravin Rao. According to filings by Infosys with stock exchanges, only 24% of promoter votes were cast in favour of the resolution seeking a 35% rise in Rao’s compensation to Rs12.5 crore. The remaining abstained. This mirrored the promoters voting 12 months ago on a <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/NZOTuzB2LnxHHpk6oGgqvM/Are-Infosys-founders-not-happy-with-Vishal-Sikka.html"" target=""_blank"">resolution seeking a two-year extension and a revised compensation of $11 million for chief executive Vishal Sikka</a>.  The latest show of promoter disenchantment, according to people familiar with the development, suggests that the truce reached between the founders and the company’s board after an open confrontation in February may only have resulted in an uneasy and temporary calm.The resolution was one of three Infosys sought to pass through electronic voting or postal ballots by 31 March. The remaining two resolutions—an amendment to its articles of association allowing Infosys to consider a share buyback, and the appointment of D.N. Prahlad as independent director—received overwhelming approval from promoters and other shareholders. Infosys founder N.R. Narayana Murthy clarified that the decision of some of the founders not to vote in favour of the proposed salary increase for Rao was because of their belief in compassionate capitalism. “This abstention has nothing to do with Pravin,” Murthy said in an emailed response to a questionnaire from <i>Mint</i>. “I have lots of affection for Pravin. Let me state you the facts. I believe in striving towards reducing differences in compensation and equity in a corporation. I have always felt that every senior management person of an Indian corporation has to show self-restraint in his or her compensation and perquisites. This is necessary if we have to make compassionate capitalism acceptable to a majority of Indians who are poor. Without compassionate capitalism, this country cannot create jobs and solve the problem of poverty. Further, giving nearly 60% to 70% increase in compensation for a top level person (even including performance-based variable pay) when the compensation for most of the employees in the company was increased by just 6% to 8% is, in my opinion, not proper.”“Finally, given the current poor governance standards at Infosys, let us also remember that these targets for variable pay may not be adhered to if the board wants to favour a top management person,” said Murthy.

Institutional investors, which include foreign institutional investors and insurance companies, hold 59% of shares in Infosys while non-institutional investors, which include retail shareholders, hold 28.1%. Five of the seven original co-founders, Murthy, Nandan Nilekani, S.D. Shibulal, Kris Gopalakrishnan and K. Dinesh are categorized as promoters of the company, and the founders together hold a 12.75% stake. None of the founders are on the board of Infosys. “No previous resolution in the history of the company has received such a low approval,” said Murthy. In April last year, Nilekani and Sudha Murty, Narayana Murthy’s wife and chairperson of the Infosys Foundation in India, approved Sikka’s reappointment until 2021 and a higher salary, as other founders abstained. A similar voting result this time suggests that both Nilekani and Sudha Murty voted in favour of Rao, too. Gopalakrishnan declined to offer a comment while emails sent to Nilekani and other founders went unanswered. An Infosys spokesperson declined to comment on how the five promoters voted. “More than 50% of the public and small institutions voting against the increase in COO’s salary is unprecedented and as far as I recall never happened in the history of Infosys,” said Venkatraman Balakrishnan, a former chief financial officer at Infosys. “It is clearly a vote of no-confidence on the practices followed by the current board to excessively compensate senior management without any direct linkage to shareholder wealth creation. The board should listen to the founders, increase transparency, improve corporate governance, restructure the board and lastly, announce a large buyback to protect shareholders’ interests.”",2017-04-03,Most of Infosys’s promoters did not vote for resolution seeking a salary hike for chief operating officer Pravin Rao,competitor,16:53,"Infosys promoters, board at odds over Pravin Rao’s salary hike"

The winners were selected after a rigorous judging process. The innovators were felicitated on 9 and 10 March at EmTech 2017, the second edition of the emerging technology conference organized in Delhi by <i>Mint</i> and <i>MIT Technology Review.</i>Akash DongreOrganization: Indus OSDesignation: Co-founder and chief product officerInnovation: A multilingual operating system available on over 50 mobile devicesEducation: BTech in mechanical engineering from IIT BombayAkash Dongre—along with co-founders Rakesh Deshmukh and Sudhir Bangarambandi—has always believed that “Indian problems require indigenous solutions”. No wonder their eponymous innovation, touted as the “world’s first regional operating system”, is blazing a trail in the Indian smartphone ecosystem. “In our short journey, beginning in 2015, we have already partnered with five domestic smartphone brands (Micromax, Intex, Karbonn, Celkon and Swipe) and built a user base of more than six million, which is consistently growing at a rate of 500,000 OS activations per month,” says Dongre. Indus OS, which is available in 12 Indian regional languages, boasts innovative features such as Indus Swipe (translation from English to a regional language and vice versa with just a swipe), Indus Keyboard (with built-in word and matra (a unit of metrical quantity in Indian languages) prediction) and Indus Reader (which can convert an English text into audio in eight regional languages). Besides, there’s a marketplace called App Bazaar, where over 50,000 apps are available in local languages.Dongre recalls one of his foreign trips when his lack of understanding of the local language made him feel handicapped: “Everything around me was in a language I did not understand.” Dongre also realized how digitally less connected the Indian heartland is and how alien English is to a lot of Indians. “After spending some more time to understand the Indian digital landscape and brainstorming with my team, we decided to start building an ecosystem for Indian consumers.” The team built Indus OS on three core pillars: simplicity, innovation and localization. “At the heart of our story lies the desire to equip anyone who is using a smartphone with a holistic ecosystem of their choice,” says Dongre.Indus OS, which introduced Indus OS 2.0 in July 2016, will introduce Indus OS 3.0 in 2017. “In 2017, we intend to continue to work with the Government of India and app developers alike to build a smartphone ecosystem of choice for the emerging markets population,” Dongre says.Ankit JhanwarOrganization: Pluss Advanced TechnologiesDesignation: Vice-president, corporate planning and strategyInnovation: A packaging box for vaccine transportation that uses phase change materials and a unique design for precise temperature controlEducation: BTech in polymer science and technology from IIT Roorkee; certificate in entrepreneurship, management and global leadership from London School of Economics and Political ScienceAn optimist by nature, Ankit Jhanwar was not put off by the disinterest displayed by some packaging companies in developing a temperature-controlled shipping solution using phase change materials (PCMs)—a domain in which his company, Pluss Advanced Technologies, had been working since 2005. Such a temperature-controlled solution could prove very useful in cutting down the 30% wastage of vaccines in the existing cold chain system in the country. So what Pluss did was develop a complete shipping solution using its own proprietary PCMs, which could not only provide better temperature control but also address the challenging Indian ambient conditions of 40°C. “A range of products were planned to address the gaps at each leg of the supply chain right from manufacturer to the depot to the distributor to chemist and finally to the patient,” says Jhanwar.The shipping solution that he developed was branded Celsure—which uses the PCM technology to provide precise temperature control. “It is the only shipping solution which provides temperature control for more than 72 hours even at ambient temperature of 40°C,” he says. Thanks to this innovation, all the current pharmaceutical shipments which happen by air can now be done by road using Celsure—something that can lead to huge savings in freight cost, thereby making it possible to lower the prices of medicines.According to Jhanwar, Celsure also addresses the unique challenge of shipping from a hot environment (say, India) to a cold environment (like Europe) or vice versa. What’s more, the solution has brought in simplicity in the packaging, removing human errors. Jhanwar says that it’s available in sizes as small as one vial to as large as 10,000 vials and can provide temperature control for as low as 2 hours to as high as 120 hours. Pluss has a goal of reducing medicine wastage due to ineffective cold chain to as low as 0.1% in the next three-five years. The firm is constantly working on scaling up and commercializing the innovation. Celsure was launched in April 2016 with only one variant; eight more variants have been added within a year. Logistics firms such as Blue Dart and DHL have adopted Celsure as one of their preferred modes of shipping temperature-sensitive pharma products. Successful trials have also been run with various pharmaceutical firms. Besides commercializing it in India, Pluss plans to go global with the launch in Singapore and the Middle East in 2018 and in the US and Europe in 2019. “We are also keen on tie-ups with the government, World Health Organization (WHO), Unicef and other related organizations for last-mile delivery of vaccines. Customized products are being planned to address the last mile challenges,” says Jhanwar. Anusha RammohanOrganization: General Electric Global ResearchDesignation: Lead engineerInnovation: Flow analytics for multi-phase flow metering in oil and gas industryEducation: BE (Hons.) in electronics and instrumentation from BITS-Pilani; MS in electrical engineering from Arizona State University, USAnusha Rammohan believes that the intersection of the digital and physical worlds is the ideal space for disruptive innovations. And that’s exactly what attracted her to the esoteric domain of flow analytics for multi-phase flow metering in the oil and gas industry.As the lead engineer at GE Global Research’s John F Welch Technology Center in Bengaluru, Anusha got the opportunity to combine physical sensors with advanced analytics to develop a solution capable of radically transforming the processes of the entire industry. “As the global energy demand continues to increase, there is an urgent need in the oil and gas industry to be more efficient with resources, people and investments to reduce the cost of producing oil while doing so safely with reduced environmental impact,” says Rammohan. Her innovation addresses this need by combining sensor and device data in the field using intelligent analytics to provide accurate and reliable information in real time about oil production. For instance, she says, timely information about well and field level production of oil, water and gas allows operators to make critical decisions related to optimizing pumps, allocating resources and energy to each well, shutting down or stimulating wells, and preventing leakage and blockage of pipes, etc. By transforming data into actionable insights, her analytics solution enables increased oil recovery, reduced human intervention and improved resource planning.Not merely restricting her innovation to a single industry, the next stop for Anusha is to extend it to applications in industries such as aviation, power and transportation. The applications include performance optimization of assets, health monitoring of safety-critical components and their increased reliability and reduced downtime—all of which can significantly improve productivity and bring down costs. Rammohan has been granted patents related to her work in image mapping, sensor positioning and flow measurement; she has filed for more. She dreams of a world powered by analytics and technologies such as artificial intelligence—one in which “autonomous decision making” would greatly reduce the ambiguity, uncertainty and human subjectivity that are currently proving to be bottlenecks in all industries.<p id=""U20332513080DkE"" style="" text-indent: 0; ;"">Kshitij Marwah<p id=""U20332513080mXC"" style="" text-indent: 0; ;"">Organization: Tesseract Imaging<p id=""U20312879031EJ"" style="" text-indent: 0; ;"">Designation: Founder<p id=""U20312879031KfE"" style="" text-indent: 0; ;"">Innovation: Virtual reality (VR) camera to create and share high resolution VR/holographic content; holographic augmented reality headset<p id=""U20312879031SEC"" style="" text-indent: 0; ;"">Education: MTech in computer science from IIT Delhi; MS in media arts and sciences from MIT Media Lab, Massachusetts, US<p class=""S3l"">Kshitij Marwah says virtual reality and augmented reality (VR and AR) are the new mediums for human beings to tell their stories in a much more “experiential and immersive manner”. It marks a natural progression, as he says:  “From the spoken word to the written word, from photos to videos—we have always found new ways and tools to tell our stories.”The power of his belief in VR and AR, backed by the rigour of his technical education (never mind that he dropped out of his PhD at MIT Media Lab), led Marwah to his innovations: Quark VR camera and the Holoboard AR viewing headset. Says he, “The Quark VR camera will democratize mixed reality content creation and the Holoboard AR headset will allow for its viewing in a truly immersive and unique manner.”Marwah has a simple way of explaining his innovation. “Imagine the next time when you are watching a cricket match in your house. Rather than sitting in front of your television, with our Quark camera streaming the match live in VR and the Holoboard headset, you can feel as if you are sitting right in the stadium but in the comfort of your couch,” he says.His current company, Tesseract Imaging (in Norse mythology, Tesseract is said to be a cosmic cube of immense power; in geometry, the tesseract is a four-dimensional hypercube), was spun out of MIT Media Lab’s India arm, a unit that Marwah had co-founded to promote and spread inter-disciplinary learning among students in India. He is credited with growing the Lab initiative from a platform of 50 students to 500 students selected from hundreds of thousands of applicants across the country. He headed the India arm of the Lab from 2012 to 2015.Marwah believes that the innovations coming out of Tesseract will revolutionize “the way we capture, consume and see content and media”. On the anvil are plans to begin shipping the Quark VR cameras in mid-2017 and Holoboard AR headsets by the end of the year. “With our technology, we believe we can make sure that our society can capture, share and consume their daily experiences and share stories across generations with an experience that is immersive and powerful.”Nishant KumarOrganization: Embryyo Technologies Pvt. LtdDesignation: Founder and CEOInnovation: Sensor and mobile app-based drug adherence monitoring system for tuberculosisEducation: Dual degree in mechanical engineering from IIT Bombay Nishant Kumar, the founder and chief exec of Embryyo Technologies, a medical technology and research start-up incubated at Pune’s Venture Centre, was troubled by the way tuberculosis (TB) treatment was left midway by a large number of patients in India. There wasn’t an effective way of ensuring patients stayed the course. “This was because the TB medication involves a drug regimen of about 6 months where the patient is required to take a total of about 400 pills,” he says. There are several reasons why treatment is left incomplete, including side effects, forgetfulness, poor counselling and duration of the regimen. The enormity of the problem—as many as 2.5 million people in India were affected by TB in 2015 as per a World Health Organization report—inspired Kumar to do something about it. He visited the local district level hospitals and direct observation treatment (DOT) centres to interact with the clinicians, healthcare workers and patients, which helped him in “collecting more insights” and further strengthened his resolve to address this problem. He says that it demanded an easy-to-use, affordable solution which could fit seamlessly in an already established public health infrastructure in the country. The result was BoxRx, an electronic medical event monitoring system that has currently been piloted for drug adherence monitoring in TB patients. According to Kumar, most people with TB are cured by a strictly followed, six-month drug regimen but any interruption to it can cause drug resistance.That is where the innovation behind BoxRx comes in handy. The solution comprises a specially designed electronic pill box which carries the TB blister pack as prescribed by the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP). A tearable paper with conductive ink tracks printed corresponding to each pill is placed beneath the blister pack before closing the box. Whenever a pill is removed from the blister pack, the conductive track gets broken and this activity is logged and transmitted from an in-built Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) circuit to a central server in the form of an SMS. The server processes the information in the SMS and updates the mobile application of the doctor/health worker assigned to that particular patient.To scale up the innovation, Kumar plans to work very closely with the national and international organizations that are leading the TB control programmes. Also on the cards is large-scale manufacturing and on-field implementation of the innovation so that it reaches the maximum number of patients. Kumar envisions a society that is centred on harmonious and sustainable co-existence. “I believe that good health is the primary signature of prosperity for an individual, a family, a nation and the world at large,” he says.Pankaj AgarwalDesignation: Creative leaderOrganization: Samsung ElectronicsInnovation: A button-type device that connects to toys and a mobile app to enable intuitive interactions for kidsEducation: BTech in electrical engineering from IIT Kanpur; MS from Seoul National University; MBA from Harvard Business SchoolWhenever Pankaj Agarwal saw his son Anant play alone with his toy blocks, a question often nagged him: “Why does he have to play alone? Is there something I can do to make play-at-home social and interactive for him?” He was also inspired to change the status quo when he looked at the many expensive toys gathering dust around his house. Agarwal thought of the millions of middle-class homes that just couldn’t afford all those high-tech toys with pricey tags.So he added a simple and interactive, yet relatively inexpensive, tag of his own: TagPlus. The innovation comprises a button-type smart tag, a smart app (for phones/tablets), and, above all, content created and shared in the cloud by kids as young as 7-year-olds. A key benefit of TagPlus is that it can increase the repeat play value of toys. An important feature of the innovation, says Agarwal, is that there is no set-up required. “No device pairing, no logins, no passwords!” When kids buy toys that have this smart tag, they can start playing on the TagPlus platform immediately after unwrapping it. Kids can “click”, “long press”, “shake” and “bump” their smart tags and the smart app will respond accordingly. A “click” on the smart tag activates the TagPlus app on a nearby digital device to show toy-related content. A “long press” action will bring on a social media interface where kids can easily upload their creations and also see the creations of other kids playing with the same toy. “Think of this as a ‘mini Facebook for kids’,” says Agarwal. A “shake” action on the smart tag will help kids find and connect with children playing with an identical toy who could be anywhere in the world. Also, when kids “bump” two tags from two different toys, the connected app shows multiple ways in which the toys can be combined to create something entirely new. Agarwal and his other TagPlus team members at Samsung believe that this patent-pending technology platform has the potential to make kids’ playing experiences more serendipitous, socially engaging and creative “by seamlessly bridging their virtual and physical play environments”. Agarwal and his colleagues did multiple pilot tests of TagPlus in South Korea and they are also in discussion with many toy makers to adopt the platform. “The response has been very positive,” he says. Agarwal plans to continue his innovative work in the creative domain and believes that “members of our society should be educated and imbibe a culture of creativity”.Prasant MisraDesignation: ScientistOrganization: TCS Research and Innovation, Tata Consultancy Services LtdInnovation: Auditory sensing for micro unmanned aerial vehicles Education: PhD in computer science and engineering from the University of New South Wales, Sydney; postdoctoral fellowship from the Swedish Institute of Computer Science, StockholmPrasant Misra has been focusing his research efforts around building “spatially intelligent systems”. His current work pertains to the auditory sensing technology for micro unmanned aerial vehicles (MUAVs, more popularly known as drones). It’s like “growing the ears” for intelligent things, as he puts it. “It is part of a grand vision to equip this category of flying robots with a sensory gamut that is on par with humans,” he says. This will not only enable such “things” to derive better spatial intelligence, but also drive cognition to a better level of autonomy by combining auditory sensing with vision.There are, however, fundamental challenges in developing such robust auditory capabilities, especially in capturing the spatial dimensions of a sound scene and analysing its acoustic signature. “The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio is extremely low due to the presence of (near-field) wideband acoustic interference (i.e., self-noise) from the MUAVs’ spinning rotors and motors, which is both strong and non-stationary,” he explains. Theoretically speaking, building an acoustic array with a large number of acoustic elements can overcome such high levels of noise, but the space, payload and energy limitations of an MUAV come in the way of meeting such exhaustive system requirements and computational needs.Misra is now investigating both lightweight acoustic sensing system design, and low-power (but efficient) computation paradigms to overcome this challenge. The initial results, he says, are quite promising.The impact of the work Misra is doing is far-reaching. It will not only force us to rethink the current model of aerial sensing (which is primarily vision dominated), but will also open up newer applications and usage scenarios for the betterment of society. It is now quite common to talk of aerial drones, especially tiny ones with multiple rotors that can hover mid-air, in applications ranging from e-commerce deliveries and inspection of industrial machinery to wildlife monitoring and search-and-rescue operations. Nevertheless, their sensing technology is predominately vision-centric. “While the advantages are clearly obvious in visual inspection and monitoring applications, on the flip side, they become unusable in camera-obstructed or low-light conditions, or in scenarios that offer non-visual clues such as those based on sound. In fact, these conditions are a norm in high-stress environments (dense canopy or fog, structures on fire, underground mines, etc.),” he says.Misra is working towards taking the MUAV technology from its existing level to “cognitive autonomous systems”. He believes that as spatial intelligence and cognitive technology mature, the lines between machines and humans would blur, enabling both to live together in the same society as companions. In the future, cognitive aerial drones will take up roles such as aerial cars and taxis, pick up and escort agents, search and rescue bots, and ears and eyes for the disabled. In short: anything you want them to be.Sandeep Senan Designation: Founder and directorOrganization: Evobi Automations Pvt. Ltd (Bibox Labs)Innovation: A toolkit-based approach to learning so that kids can learn through experiments by making things like a robotic toy or a fire alarmEducation: BE in computer science from Visvesvaraya Technological University, Karnataka; MBA in international business from Edith Cowan University, AustraliaWhen it comes to innovation and creativity, Sandeep Senan is as excited as the young kids he wants to empower with the innovative tools at his disposal. His innovation, Bibox (short for Brain-in-a-box), is like an “electronic brain which can be instructed by a kid using a graphical software, which can run on a tablet or smartphone or PC or even with cards”, he says. Senan is of the view that the realm of innovation must be extended to children rather than remain mostly confined to the adult world. There’s a need for a huge change in the way children are taught and allowed to be creative, he feels.“The task of making adults creative is a humongous task, but if we think about kids, they are naturally curious and thus it’s easy to instill an innovative thinking process in them,” says Senan. So when he discovered that there was a lack of tools and curricula designed for instilling the habit of innovation in kids, he decided to do something about it.“The innovation Bibox was originated out of that need to give kids the tools to change the world and thus the confidence to keep innovating and make it a habit so that when they become adults, they can go out and make large-scale impact because the thinking is ingrained into their minds,” he says.Bibox doesn’t have a definite shape or size but is basically a set of tools—processors, switches, sensors, battery and software, among others—using which children in different age groups can try their hand at innovation. This “brain”, says Senan, can be connected to a variety of accessories, including toys, lights and TV sets, and children can come up with stuff like walking robotic dogs, automatic TV and even connected health products using the Internet of Things.“Because Bibox responds to kids’ logic in the physical world, they can see what the logic means and correct themselves when required—making the learning experience truly experiential,” he says. Besides providing them such toolkits, Senan’s organization also provides them some structured mentoring to enable them to use their creative freedom and confidence to innovate more and more in any field they choose to be in. “We are just getting the process started a little early,” he says. Through Bibox Labs, he has enrolled more than 25,000 students in over 100 schools in India.To take his innovative ways to a much larger base of students, Senan and his team are digitizing the process of mentoring the kids to be innovators. Once this is in place, he says, any student anywhere in the world would be able to go through the same process that Bibox Labs follows in its affiliate schools. They also plan to partner with private firms, non-governmental organizations and various government bodies to scale up the programme.Subham Banerjee Designation: Young scientistOrganization: Centre for Biodesign and Diagnostic, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, department of biotechnologyInnovation: Transdermal patch against neurotoxin poisoningEducation: Master of pharmacy from West Bengal University of Technology; PhD in pharmacy from Birla Institute of Technology, MesraSoldiers fighting in hostile territories often have to shield themselves against harmful or poisonous gases and chemical substances. One often hears of deadly strikes such as the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system (1995), the nerve gas attack in Syria (2013) or the recent attack in Iraq by Islamic State militants in which they set fire to a sulphur mine, spreading sulphur dioxide plumes.Subham Banerjee’s innovation concerns protecting people against neurotoxic poisoning resulting from such attacks. “The exposure of humans to neurotoxins is a major risk factor in severe mortality in chemical or biological warfare situations, as neurotoxins are one of the most potent toxins,” he says. His innovation, a transdermal patch that can provide protection against neurotoxin poisoning, comprises an inert adhesive matrix system with active pharmaceutical ingredients. The patch can be applied to intact or even burnt or blistered skin. It works by releasing a combination drug (eserine and pralidoxime chloride) through the skin in what is called a “controlled or sustained release” mechanism.According to Banerjee, the new patch has “an excellent safety profile”, can be “self-administered”, and has positive environmental as well as economic impact. “Apart from conventional dosage forms, no novel sustained release prophylactic transdermal patches are currently available in the market,” he says. Which is why this innovation has huge socio-economic benefits and the potential to achieve product dominance in the market.In order to sustain this project and take it to the next level of successful commercialization, however, Banerjee says that some studies have to be carried out. For one, process parameters have to be optimized to scale up the capability of manufacturing these patches in bulk quantities. Also, a preclinical toxicity study in rodents needs to be done, followed by a full-fledged pilot for the bioavailability study in human subjects as per the guidelines of the Drug Controller General of India.Banerjee believes that this innovation has the potential to make an “extra value-addition” to the existing measures for biological warfare protection available with India’s Armed Forces.Vinay Kumar Designation: Co-founder, director and CEOOrganization: PathShodh Healthcare Pvt. LtdInnovation: A single device that can diagnose multiple parameters related to diabetes managementEducation: MTech in microelectronics and VLSI design and MSc in electronic science from Kurukshetra University; PhD from Centre for Nano Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Science BangaloreAt age 14, when Vinay Kumar was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes, his doctor told him he would have to take insulin injections. The look of disappointment on his face prompted the physician to lie that it was only for 10 days that injections were needed. Later on, when Kumar realized that he was stuck with the needle for a lifetime, he became determined to put the hurt and discomfort behind and do something about it. Over the years, diabetes took a bigger and bigger toll on his body, with episodes of hypoglycemia (abnormally low level of sugar in the blood) and even fainting—but all this only strengthened his resolve.In addition to struggling with a debilitating condition like millions in the world do, Kumar constantly thought about how a diabetic can manage his condition better and, at the same time, persisted with his studies. “These two aspects of my life merged when I decided to pursue a PhD at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc Bangalore),” he says. Besides working on novel ways to diagnose diseases and acquiring multiple patents, he also co-founded (along with Navakanta Bhat and Gautam Sharma) PathShodh Healthcare Pvt. Ltd, a start-up incubated at IISc that is focused on medical device research and development.Kumar’s innovation is a hand-held point-of-care device which, as a single unit, can measure eight different parameters related to diabetes management and early detection of its complications. “With a tiny drop of finger-pricked blood samples, patients can test HbA1c (which gives 90 days blood glucose control profile), glycated albumin (which gives 15 days blood glucose control profile) and instant blood glucose as well,” he says. The device can detect very early damage in the kidney by measuring the microalbuminuria, creatinine and ACR (albumin to creatinine ratio) in the urine samples. Apart from these, he adds, it can measure the haemoglobin level for anaemia and chronic kidney disease. “The device can measure serum albumin, an important blood marker for kidney and liver. So the single device can take care of full diabetes glycaemic management and early detection of complications such as diabetic nephropathy,” explains Kumar.The road ahead for PathShodh is well-defined. “The device is ready and regress clinical validation for most of the tests has been completed on real patient samples in collaboration with major pathology labs and hospitals in Bangalore. We also have the manufacturing line setup at IISc to manufacture the disposable test strips for these different tests,” says Kumar. The commercial launch of the device can happen any time now. That would certainly move the needle in a positive direction for PathShodh’s mission of making healthcare diagnostics affordable and available to all.",2017-03-31,Meet the 10 winners of the Mint-MIT Technology Review competition for innovators below the age of 35 from across India in different cutting-edge domains,company,17:26,EmTech 2017: Innovators under 35

US Citizenship and Immigration Services said employers seeking H-1B work visas—a non-immigrant visa allowing American firms to employ foreign workers—for 2018 declined for the first time in five years.The surge in the number of applicants has been triggered by Trump’s vows to protect jobs for locals. A <i>Bloomberg </i>report on Tuesday said Trump will take aim at information technology outsourcing companies when he orders a review of H-1B visa programmes to favour more skilled and highly paid applicants. The report also cited companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. and Mphasis Corp. as examples of outsourcing firms that would likely have fewer visas approved once the changes are adopted. The H-1B work visa programme channels thousands of foreign workers to the US technology industry.“While US companies will find some tech talent in the US, the numbers might be less than what are required to meet their needs. Add to that, the wages they need to pay to US employees will be much higher than what they pay to H-1B visa holders,” said C.K. Guruprasad, a consultant with executive search firm Spencer Stuart.On Tuesday, Australia abolished the 457 visa programme used by over 95,000 temporary foreign workers, the majority of them Indians, to tackle unemployment.Experts see global in-house centres (GICs) as a viable option for companies to not only retain Indian talent but also address the anticipated shortage in the required volume of workers in the US.According to Parag Saigaonkar, Principal at consulting firm Deloitte in India, while the initial thrust of GICs was on moving job roles from a high-cost to low-cost centre to get a competitive edge, companies are now looking at non-linear values that GICs can add to the business—new things that Indian GICs can produce—and supporting the parent organization.“With the seemingly shifting dynamics towards options between outsourcing and local hiring, companies with GICs in India could move Indian talent from the US to India and also hire locals into the GICs and thus sidestep the restrictions of outsourcing to third party companies,” Guruprasad said.According to K.S.Viswanathan, vice-president for industry initiatives at lobby group Nasscom, while the purpose of GICs so far has revolved around cost and skills arbitration advantages and talent consideration, it is now expected to change.“We are seeing a lot of companies looking at building newer competencies around newer technologies like machine learning, AI, automation, UI/UX, product management, DevOps etc,” said Anand Subramaniam, engagement manager and delivery head (GIC Accelerator Platform), Zinnov, a consulting firm.On an average, GICs add 50,000 to 70,000 people in India every year and due to the volume requirements, this number is expected to go up, according to Nasscom. According to the lobby group, there are over 1,000 GICs in India. Of these, around 67% of them are of US origin. Around 65% of the total workforce of 750,000 employed by these GICs are for US origin companies.",2017-04-19,The number of Indians in the US searching for jobs in India has surged 10-fold since December as Donald Trump moved to tighten US visa policy,both,11:07,"As US visa troubles deepen, more Indians look to come back"

-0.12,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""S3l"">The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plans to allow market participants to substitute collateral under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) window to give them more flexibility and improve the liquidity of these instruments.This facility will be available from 17 April, the regulator said on its website. Under the repo window, banks have to place government bonds as collateral to borrow from the central bank. Separately, the regulator said that it will continue using methods such as open market operations, cash management bills, treasury bills and variable rate repo and reverse repo securities to drain excess liquidity from the system. It also laid out several other regulatory proposals for the banking and financial system. For one, the regulator plans to introduce a new and improved prompt corrective action (PCA) framework for banks with weak balance sheets. Typically, when a bank breaches the lower limit of its capital base during any quarter, along with a build-up of large amount of bad loans and fall in return on assets, RBI initiates this action to limit the bank’s lending activities and help it fix its affairs. Banks under PCA would be required to conform to mandatory and discretionary actions that the central bank would decide. RBI said the revised framework would be issued by mid-April 2017. Speaking on the asset quality problems in Indian banking after RBI’s monetary policy announcement, deputy governor S.S. Mundra said the regulator, and banks in general, are cognizant of the fact that there is no one-size-fits-all approach while attempting resolution of stressed loans. Mundra said that the regulator is considering new measures to deal with bad loans while also tweaking existing stress resolution tools if necessary.The Rs7 trillion bad loan problem in the Indian banking sector is led by public sector banks, which are struggling with recovery and resolution of stress on their books.RBI has also decided to increase the entry barrier for asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) by mandating a net owned funds base of Rs100 crore compared with Rs2 crore earlier. Detailed guidelines in this matter would be released later this month, the regulator has said. Separately, the regulator is also planning on allowing banks to invest in Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs). RBI has also decided to not activate the countercyclical capital buffer as of now, which would have forced banks to set aside a certain portion of their capital as a buffer for difficult times.The central bank plans to introduce steps to improve the national electronic funds transfer (NEFT) infrastructure, rationalize the merchant discount rate (MDR) and issue renewed guidelines on the issuance and operation of prepaid payments instruments (PPIs), it said.RBI said that it is initiating a pilot project on financial literacy at the block level to explore innovative and participatory approaches to financial literacy. A pilot project will be commissioned in nine states across 80 blocks by non-government organizations (NGOs) in collaboration with the sponsor banks. The sponsor banks will enter into contracts with the identified NGOs by 30 June. Thereafter, the NGOs will start operating the centre for financial literacy within three months of entering into contracts with banks.",2017-04-07,"RBI also said that it will continue using methods such as open market operations, cash management bills and treasury bills to drain excess liquidity from the system",competitor,01:32,RBI to allow banks to substitute collateral under LAF window

-0.55,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""S3l"">Early in the morning of Monday, 3 April, serendipity sat me next to N.R. Narayana Murthy on a long transcontinental flight leaving Bengaluru. As the flight attendants handed out newspapers for the passengers to read while on the journey, I couldn’t help but notice that Murthy had made front-page news, this time for questioning the extent of the raise given to an executive at Infosys Ltd, the company that he founded over three decades ago along with a few of his junior colleagues. I turned to him and we began a conversation. I shall not focus here on the specific comments about Infosys, but there were several parts of the conversation that covered Murthy’s philosophy around topics that I have written about in this column before, and which provide insights into the character of the man. Unsurprisingly, we spoke of the social issues being caused by the changes in the way corporations recruit and retain talent. We spoke of organizations such as TopCoder, now part of an Indian IT services firm after the acquisition of its parent by Wipro. TopCoder is a marketplace for computer programmers, who can get compensated for their work through this marketplace without ever having to be an employee of a services firm. It is like a taxi aggregator among programming firms. I have written in this column before about how marketplaces like these can eventually change the construct of the employer-employee contract now prevalent among many firms and have also mused about whether unionization may be around the corner at some Indian IT services firms as the employer-employee relationship construct begins to disintegrate.Murthy explained that there are circumstances where unions can play a pivotal role in ensuring equity. He said the fact that unions look out for employees’ welfare is inescapable, and proffered the example of the US. According to him, when unionization covered 35% of the American workforce, American labour was better looked after. Now that this figure has slipped to around 15%, the poor have become poorer as corporations and their leaders have followed an Ayn-Rand-esque view of “rational self-interest” and social Darwinism. Pushing crumbs off one’s table and trusting that the aspiring classes in society will have enough is a sure recipe in fomenting labour class unrest, as the recent Brexit and US presidential elections have shown. Murthy’s opinion is that such unrest is also lying dormant and is barely beneath the surface in India, and that leaders of India’s capitalist revolution cannot afford to blithely ignore this.Also read | <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/lFfFABxwjGRidEEKm39X8K/Infosys-justifies-pay-hike-for-COO-says-effective-rise-only.html"" target=""_blank"">Infosys strongly defends COO pay hike criticized by Narayana Murthy</a>We also spoke of the fledgling experiments with universal basic income (UBI) that have begun to pop up in various corners of the earth. UBI is essentially a dole paid out to every citizen, whether they are out of work or not, in a nod to the fact that relentless mechanization and automation will take away many people’s livelihoods in the near- to medium-term future. While classical economics tells us that disruptive changes in labour mechanics such as offshoring and automation only cause a temporary loss in jobs before there is a “job shift” when people start to work in other fields of endeavour so that they may earn a living, the short-term pain caused by the original job displacement is undeniable. UBI is a well-meaning attempt to alleviate some of that pain. It comes with the same plethora of problems around unemployment doles, but Murthy’s view was that societies have a responsibility to their underprivileged or displaced populaces and that he would welcome higher taxes on the IT industry that are meant to go directly to those whose jobs IT displaces. He said that the only society that is stable is one that is seen to be moving, however haltingly, towards an atmosphere of equity and fairness among all its members.Leaders in the IT industry need to be seen as fair by the people under their command. Giving raises at the top that are 10 or even 20 times the rate of the raises being given at the bottom runs the risk of creating an impression that those at the top are greedy opportunists most interested in snatching what they can while the going is good. I have been part of a company where the boss raised his own salary by over 250%, leaving others in his second line like me to explain to the rest of the workforce that they had to make do with a 2% increase. The rationale for the anaemic salary increase for everyone but the boss was that the firm had not reached its (internally set) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, targets. As an aside, I am sure the boss’s new salary contributed to the company repeating this miss in the next year. That year, even though my own compensation increase was also in the low single digits, I felt great discomfiture at having to justify and explain the boss’s salary increase, which the board had seen right to give him since “he could easily get another job in the industry paying just as much”. To paraphrase the Bard of Avon, all the mouthwash in India has not cured me of the ensuing halitosis from those conversations.Recalling a time when the industry finally saw the light and banded together in the common interest to fight high levels of attrition when companies were blithely poaching talent from one another, I asked Murthy whether Nasscom or some such industry body could now be entrusted with this looming question of “fairness”. He was unequivocal that an ombudsman is needed.

-0.23,"US President Donald Trump and members of Congress from both parties have vowed to overhaul the visa programmes used by corporations to bring overseas workers to the US. That’s left companies that rely on such workers and those that source them bracing for change. A first step came at the end of March, when the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) department issued guidelines making it harder for companies to bring foreign technology workers to the US using the H-1B visa programme.What’s the H-1B programme do?It allows companies to recruit 85,000 employees from abroad each year for specialty positions in fields including technology, science, medicine, architecture—even fashion modelling. It took less than a week for applicants to exhaust that allotment in 2016, and technology companies including Facebook Inc., Google Inc., Intel Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. have sought to increase the number available. People from India receive more H-1B vis’s  than any other nationality.What changes were made? For H-1B visas given out in the 2017 lottery beginning 3 April, the government now requires additional information for entry-level computer programmers, to prove the jobs are complicated and require advanced knowledge and experience. Computer programmers made up about 12% of all H-1B applications certified by the department of labour in 2015. Also Read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Politics/EdQ94piZ2P3zVdhdUoIPdI/Donald-Trump-begins-crackdown-on-H1B-visa-program.html"" target=""_blank"">H-1B visas to become harder to get as Donald Trump starts crackdown</a>In March, the immigration department suspended a program that expedited visa processing for certain skilled workers who paid extra, which some analysts saw as a first step to dismantling the H-1B program altogether.Which other programs are under scrutiny?Apart from the best-known H-1B visa, companies use a variety of visas to bring in workers from abroad, including the B-1 for temporary business visitors and the L-1 for managers, executives and specialized workers of international companies.Why does the US have these programmes?They were designed to allow US companies to hire temporary workers from other countries when they couldn’t find qualified people domestically. These temporary visas were established under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. The programs have morphed over the years, and many of the visas now go to companies that pay foreign workers less than their American counterparts would receive. The total number of visas issued for temporary employment-based admission to the US grew to more than 1 million in 2014 from just over 400,000 in 1994, according to the Congressional Research Service. Those numbers included some unskilled and low-skilled workers, plus accompanying family members.Do the programmes need reform?It’s pretty clear the H-1B program and others have been used in ways that contradict their original intent. There have been allegations of abuse and at least one big settlement: In 2013, a Bangalore-based outsourcing company, Infosys Ltd., agreed to pay a record fine of $34 million to settle US allegations that it sent employees to the US with B-1 visitor visas to sidestep the caps on H-1Bs.What does Trump propose?During his presidential campaign, he said the H-1B program is a “cheap labour program” that takes jobs from Americans. He hasn’t yet detailed his ideas as president, but based on a draft executive order, his administration may push companies to try hiring American workers before turning to foreign ones—a step that isn’t necessary now. He’s also asked that the programmes prioritize giving visas to the most highly paid workers from abroad. Who gets priority now?Currently, H-1B visas are allocated by random lottery, with no priority given to companies that pay workers more. The biggest recipients of the visas are outsourcing companies, including India’s Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Wipro Ltd. and Infosys. They pay workers in the programme an average of about $65,000 a year, while Apple Inc., Google and Microsoft Corp. pay their H-1B employees more than $100,000.Can Trump act on his own?An executive order can begin the reform process, but Trump lacks the broad powers of Congress. For example, he can’t change the number of H-1B visas that are given out each year, but he probably can change the way they’re allocated. So he could order that priority be given to higher-paid workers.What might Congress do?Congress has tried many times in the past decade to change the work visa programmes, with limited effect. Bills offered in the House by two California lawmakers, Republican Darrell Issa and Democrat Zoe Lofgren, aim to do so by raising the wages for some H-1B workers.Also Read:<a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Politics/hJEg51euoJYRmUIEXoKZHO/H1B-visa-Computer-programmer-not-to-qualify-as-specialty-o.html"" target=""_blank""> H1B visa: Computer programmer won’t qualify as specialty occupation , says US</a>In Lofgren’s proposal, companies that are the heaviest users of the programme would have to pay salaries of at least $130,000, up from the current $60,000, or attest that they are not displacing American workers and making a good faith effort to recruit US workers if they pay less than that. The legislative push has spooked India’s tech companies, weighing on their stocks. There’s also a bipartisan proposal in the Senate, long pushed by Republican Chuck Grassley and Democrat Richard Durbin, that would forbid replacing US workers with H-1B hires and prioritize visa applications from people who earned degrees at American colleges.Will Silicon Valley be hurt by the changes?It depends on the details, of course, but the US tech industry may well come out on top. Because so many H-1B visas go to outsourcing firms, American employers like Apple, Google, Microsoft Corp. and Facebook haven’t been able to get as many as they would like. They could be benefit if outsourcers face more restrictions.

-0.79,"New Delhi: Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil producer, is interested in picking a stake in India’s biggest oil refinery being planned to be set up in Maharashtra at a cost of Rs1.8 trillion. State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) together plan to set up a 60-million tonnes a year oil refinery on west coast to meet the rising fuel needs of the country. “Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (Adnoc) are talking to us for investments in the Indian oil sector,” Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said at the Global Natural Resources Conclave.Later talking to reporters, he said Aramco is interested in picking a stake in the west coast refinery while Adnoc is keen on petrochemical projects. “Aramco is talking of stake in the refinery,” he said. He, however, did not go into how much stake the Saudi national oil company will pick. “Let’s see,” is all he said. IOC holds a 50% stake in the project while BPCL and HPCL have 25% each. The 60-mt a year refinery will be set up in two phases, along with a mega petrochemical complex. The phase-1 capacity will be 40 mt together with an aromatic complex, naphtha cracker unit and a polymer complex. This will cost Rs1.2-1.5 lakh crore and will come up in 5-6 years from the date of land acquisition. The mega complex will require 12,000-15,000 acres and land on the Maharashtra coast has been identified, he said. The second phase, involving a 20 mt refinery, will cost Rs 50,000-60,000 crore. IOC has been looking at the west coast for a refinery as the company found it tough to cater to requirements in West and South with its refineries mostly in the North. HPCL and BPCL too have been looking at a bigger refinery because of constraints they face at their Mumbai units. The mega west coast refinery will produce petrol, diesel, LPG, ATF (aviation turbine fuel) and feedstock for petrochemical plants in plastic, chemical and textile industries in Maharashtra. A top official at one of the state refiners said the project will be funded with 60% debt and 40% equity.The three refiners will chip in Rs72,000 crore in equity. Fifteen mt a year is the biggest refinery any public sector unit has set up at one stage. IOC recently started its 15 mt unit at Paradip in Odisha. Reliance Industries holds the distinction of building the biggest refinery in India till now. It built its first refinery at Jamnagar in Gujarat with a capacity of 27 mt, which was subsequently expanded to 33 mt.It built another unit adjacent to it for exports, with a capacity of 29 mt.  The refinery being planned by the state-owned firms will be bigger than that. The phase-1 itself will be bigger than any one single unit. India has a refining capacity of 232.06 mt, which exceeded the demand of 183.5 mt in 2015-16. According to the International Energy Agency (EA), this demand is expected to reach 458 mt by 2040.",2017-04-06,"Saudi Aramco shows interest in buying a stake in west coast refinery project, wherein Indian Oil holds a 50% stake, while BPCL and HPCL have 25% each ",competitor,17:10,"Saudi Aramco keen to take stake in west coast refinery, says oil minister"
-0.33,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""S3l"">Ten years after Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) entered fuel retailing in South Africa, the wheel has turned full circle.India’s largest private sector company bought a 76% stake in fuel retailer Gulf Africa Petroleum Corp. (Gapco) in August 2007 and hoped to expand its footprint further in the continent. At a time when RIL was struggling with its fuel retailing in India, the move helped RIL deploy its expertise in fuel retailing overseas and find a market for its products outside India.That affair lasted a decade, almost.Last June, RIL announced its intention to sell Gapco to France’s Total SA. On 29 March, the Indian company said it has obtained all approvals to complete the sale of its Gapco stake. “RIL was happy with Gapco’s performance. Though it was not as huge as its India operations, for 10 years, Gapco did provide RIL with a reason to keep operating in the fuel retail segment. RIL had plans to expand in the neighbouring markets in Africa too,” said a person familiar with the decision to sell Gapco, on condition of anonymity.With subsidiaries in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda engaged in petroleum products import, trading and marketing among others, Gapco’s revenue for 2015-16 stood at Rs11,723 crore, according to RIL’s annual report for the year. Currently, Gapco operates 104 fuel retail outlets in the East African region — 65 in Tanzania; 30 in Uganda and nine in Kenya. So, why has RIL dropped a subsidiary that seemed to be doing well? The first person cited above and another close to the company said, after India allowed market pricing of fuel, RIL’s fuel retailing business has recovered and the company wants to put all its energy into expanding in India, the world’s third-largest crude oil consumer. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India beat Japan as the world’s third-largest crude oil consumer in 2016. India will also become the world’s third-largest-refiner in 2022, surpassing Russia. “RIL has always been bullish on the India market. And its management now wants to focus on India. Gapco happened when India operations were down. Then, RIL had decided to put its management bandwidth to use in Gapco. With all international petroleum retailers eyeing the India market, it makes sense to divest in Africa and focus back home,” said the second person familiar with RIL’s move. RIL did not reply to an email sent on Friday. RIL’s interest in the Indian fuel retailing segment was rekindled in October 2014 when the government freed diesel prices. Petrol was deregulated in June 2010. Like state-owned oil marketing companies, for RIL too, diesel has been the key product, bringing in the maximum volume. Diesel deregulation meant a revival of its fuel outlets. RIL’s Diesel sales accounted for 14.3% of the total diesel sales in the country, while its petrol sales accounted for 7.2% of total petrol sales in the country in 2005-06, RIL’s fuel retailing heydays.Since 2008, when crude oil prices rose to $150 a barrel, diesel retail was the monopoly of  Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL), which managed to sell fuel below cost with government support, something not available for RIL. In May 2008, RIL closed its fuel pumps. The company, which at one point explored tying up with oil marketing companies to stay afloat, abandoned the plans after fuel price deregulation. RIL, which had a 12% market share in fuel retailing in 2005, slipped to less than 0.5% in 2014. Since then, it has clawed back to around 3-4%. RIL had spent Rs5,000 crore in setting up 1,470 retail outlets, of which around 1,151 were operational till the third quarter of 2016-17. The company planned to reopen all its fuel retail outlets by the fourth quarter of 2016-17. Last fiscal, RIL also began reporting its fuel retailing figures. Its retail outlets, which are company-owned and company-operated, are now included in its organized retail business.",2017-04-05,"After India allowed market pricing of fuel, RIL’s fuel retailing business has recovered and the company wants to put all its energy into expanding at home",competitor,08:15,What next for Reliance Industries after Gapco sale?

0.38,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"">If you trade in bitcoins, or even are a bitcoin enthusiast, it’s unlikely that you would have missed the raging debate around the cryptocurrency. Known as the bitcoin “fork”, the controversy potentially threatens to split the bitcoin currency, whose price is currently around $1,200, into two.For the uninitiated, there are two factions at the heart of the debate, which is primarily about how to scale up the bitcoin to handle more transactions. The two current camps are: Bitcoin Unlimited and Segregated Witness (SegWit). Bitcoin Unlimited aims to remove the block size limit altogether, thereby allowing the miners to reach a consensus on their own. SegWit offers a moderate increase of the block size to up to 4 megabytes (MB), moving some non-critical data out of the blocks.The reason: Bitcoin currently has a 1MB block size limit. This implies that, on average, a network bitcoin can only process 1MB of transaction data every 10 minutes—about seven transactions per second as compared to the thousands of transactions per second that credit card firm Visa can process. The problem first surfaced around 2014-15, and bitcoin users are now increasingly experiencing long wait times as the mempool, or the buffer of yet-unconfirmed transactions, <a onclick=""return printpage('https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-mempool-spikes-again-as-capacity-nears-segwit-support-grows')"" href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-mempool-spikes-again-as-capacity-nears-segwit-support-grows"">is showing more spikes</a>.ALSO READ : <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/i4m3bOZwlKbOUmMEWmQywK/Blockchain-is-second-only-to-Artificial-Intelligence-Brock.html"" target=""_blank"">Blockchain is second only to artificial intelligence: Brock Pierce</a>Brock Pierce, founder and managing partner at Blockchain Capital and chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, believes that bitcoin has the “high class” problem of experiencing rapid growth. “Users and entrepreneurs building new business models off the blockchain means that there are competing interests on how best to scale the network. Linux, also an open source software project, had similar growing pains. It is possible that Bitcoin will fork at some point. The question is whether or not it’ll be a contentious fork. This process is a good thing in the long term, though potentially disruptive in the short term,” he said.Pointing out that “there have been multiple attempts to alter bitcoin away from the core developers that have created bitcoin as we know it today (Bitcoin Classic etc.)”, Pierce said, “To date, caution regarding a contentious hard fork has prevailed and bitcoin has thrived. If it (the split) were to happen, we may see two currencies, though I suspect one would be the dominant currency/chain.”Earlier attempts at fixing this problem comprised the BIP 100 and BIP 101 proposals—BIP stands for bitcoin improvement proposal. They were introduced in 2015 by Bitcoin Core developers Jeff Garzik and Gavin Andresen, respectively. BIP 100 was about making miners decide the block size limit while BIP 101 was a one-time increase from 1MB to 8MB. Both are known as hard-fork solutions, which means that had they been implemented, older versions of bitcoin software would become incompatible with the new network.According to <i>Cointelegraph.com</i>, the abolition of the block size limit proposed by Bitcoin Unlimited could lead to an “uncontrolled Blockchain bloat”. Currently, the size of the entire blockchain exceeds 100 gigabytes.

That runs contrary to the very idea of Bitcoin as the money governed by each of its users”, the article in <i>Cointelegraph.com</i> explains.

Since a huge number of users in India store their funds on exchanges and Web wallets, they expect to have a more seamless experience as the service operators themselves should be able to take care of some of the steps involved in the fork. The chances are slim for a majority to vote into a hard fork like Bitcoin Unlimited at this moment, however soft forks like Segregated Witness seem a lot more practical to implement on a decentralized distributed network,” he adds.The bitcoin code was first released on 9 January 2009, by a person who assumed the name, <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/HCOsKkuruKgpfOub8aiqjI/Is-Craig-Wright-the-inventor-of-bitcoin-The-answer-may-not.html"" target=""_blank"">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>. Ever since, the digital currency has been adopted for everything from international money transfers to online narco-trafficking. If you have installed a bitcoin wallet on your computer or mobile phone, it will generate your first bitcoin address and you can create more whenever you need one. You can disclose your addresses to your friends so that they can pay you or vice versa. Bitcoin users can buy and sell the currency among themselves. A shared public ledger called the “block chain” contains every transaction ever processed, allowing a user’s computer to verify the validity of each transaction of this virtual currency. The authenticity of each transaction is protected by a digital signature corresponding to the sender’s address, allowing users to have full control over sending bitcoins from their own bitcoin addresses. Hence, the digital money is also known as a “cryptocurrency”. Anyone can process transactions using the computing power of specialized hardware and earn a reward in bitcoins for this service—a process known as mining. Japan may soon become the first country to recognize bitcoins as legal tender. Some countries such as China could go a step further to issue their own version of the digital currency. In India, the Reserve Bank of India has not declared bitcoin illegal but simply cautioned users, holders and traders of virtual currencies, about the potential financial, operational, legal and security-related risks that they are exposing themselves to.On 27 February, bitcoin start-ups Zebpay, Unocoin, Coinsecure and SearchTrade jointly launched the Digital Asset and Blockchain Foundation of India (DABFI) for the “orderly and transparent growth of virtual currency market”.

-1.0,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""S3l"">Mumbai: Dell Technologies, the company that was formed when Dell Inc. acquired EMC Corp. for $67 billion, remains bullish on its “long-term” growth prospects in India, which is the company’s third-largest market.“I think we are on track to hit the $3 billion revenue mark in this country in a couple of years,” Thomas Sweet, executive vice-president and chief financial officer (CFO), Dell Inc., said in an interview last week.Explaining why he is bullish on the Indian market, Sweet reasoned that the country now had “a government that is pro-growth, pro-development, and which is also pro-technology in helping to enable that growth and the government’s mission”. Further, he claimed that the Dell-EMC combine in India is growing faster than the domestic IT market growth. According to Nasscom’s Strategic Review 2017 report, in FY2017, India’s domestic IT-BPM (information technology-business process management) market is likely to grow 8.5% year on year to reach $38 billion (excluding e-commerce).To accelerate the pace of growth globally, Dell rolled out a distribution, or the so-called channel strategy in February. According to Sweet, half of the company’s revenue is routed through its distributors and his company hopes to increase their output with the recent reorganization it initiated to bring together the distribution partners of the erstwhile Dell and EMC companies.What the company did two months back, according to Sweet, was to merge the EMC and Dell sales forces (which existed as separate entities before the merger) into two units. One is an enterprise sales unit that would now focus on the top 3,000 customers, and the second is a commercial sales organization that will focus on an estimated 500,000 clients. Sweet said he is “pretty pleased” with how the combined sales units have shaped up so far.The company also plans to sharpen its focus on its digital transformation push. Dell Technologies breaks up digital transformation into three parts, according to Sweet: IT transformation-how IT can support what the business needs; security transformation-how a company can tackle multiple threats; and workforce transformation-how an organization makes its employees more productive in a mobile environment.In the past couple of years, most large technology solution providers such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. (HPE), International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), Accenture Plc., Oracle Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., Microsoft Corp. and others have been competing fiercely for the increasingly lucrative digital transformation pie. According to research firm International Data Corp. (IDC) forecasts, global spending on digital transformation technologies is projected to be more than $1.2 trillion in 2017—an increase of 17.8% over 2016.“There is clearly a greater focus among our customers on digital, but most of them are currently focused on IT transformation,” said Sweet. According to him, companies are looking to modernize their IT infrastructure to support cloud-native applications. In cloud computing, companies can consume IT services and only pay for the applications or infrastructure they use rather than buy the equipment upfront, thus reducing capital expenditure (capex).One change in the way technology adoption occurs in companies, according to Sweet, is the growing involvement of top management, especially when it comes to digital. “We are seeing more C-suite executives, particularly the chief executive officers (CEOs), chief operating officers (COOs) and CFOs, participating in the conversation on digital as, increasingly, they are seeking business solutions and business model evolution,” he said. The focus for CFOs, he said, continues to be on return on investment, even as most of them are also ready to bet on emerging technologies that are still not mature in order to future-proof their organizations.Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst of Greyhound Research, said that while the Dell-EMC combine has done a good job of “integrating the channel network” of both the organizations, managing the reskilling of the partners and introducing customised solutions tailored for specific industry segments may require an intensive focus, especially in the short term. “If they can manage this aspect well, they can have an edge in the digital transformation infrastructure market, where companies such as HPE and Lenovo have been showing renewed aggression of late,” he concluded.",2017-04-20,Dell Inc.

We believe that RHI would be an excellent platform for building an enduring health insurance franchise in India,” Vikram Nirula, partner at True North said in the statement.True North has so far successfully launched five separate investment funds with a combined corpus of over $2 billion.The stake sale comes at a time when Religare’s promoters Malvinder and Shivinder Singh have been reported to be keen on divesting stakes in other businesses controlled by them.In January, <i>Mint</i> reported that <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/9ZDDxv6Q0p02i8gjzQJLwM/Bain-Capital-joins-KKR-TPG-in-race-for-Fortis-Healthcare-st.html"" target=""_blank"">the brothers were in talks with several global private equity funds such as TPG Capital, Bain Capital and KKR to sell a stake in their hospitals business—Fortis Healthcare Ltd</a>.

On 5 January, <i>Mint</i> had reported on the talks between KKR and the Singh brothers for a majority stake in Fortis, alongside a structured equity deal in RHC Holding Pvt. Ltd (RHPL). RHPL is the holding firm for the Religare and Fortis brands.Singh brothers are also exploring debt financing options.In November, <i>Mint</i> reported that RHPL was in talks to refinance $300 million debt. RHPL is a closely held investment company owned by Singh brothers. As of 31 March 2016, RHPL had a total net worth of around Rs6,900 crore and a debt of Rs4,064 crore.The various stakes sale plans are, however, overshadowed by an ongoing legal battle with Japanese drug maker Daiichi Sankyo.The case relates to enforcement of an arbitral award in proceedings initiated by Daiichi Sankyo against the Singh brothers in relation to its 2008 purchase of a majority stake in Ranbaxy, then owned by the brothers. The arbitral award came after the Japanese company alleged that the Singh brothers had concealed crucial information while selling Ranbaxy to it for $4.6 billion in 2008.A Singapore tribunal has ordered the brothers to pay Rs2,562 crore, which they are contesting in the Delhi High Court.In March, the court directed Singh brothers to furnish, within a week, details of all of their unencumbered assets, in order to ensure the use of such assets to satisfy the arbitral award, at a later stage, if required, <i>Mint</i> reported on 7 March.",2017-04-10,"Religare Enterprises Ltd sale of its 80% stake in Religare Health Insurance to True North and other investors values the firm at Rs1,300 crore",competitor,21:33,"Religare sells 80% stake in health insurance arm to True North, others"
-0.24,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""S3l"">New Delhi: In deals potentially valued at around Rs12,000 crore, state-owned NLC India Ltd has shortlisted for acquisition GMR Group’s 1,370 megawatt (MW) coal power project in Chhattisgarh and Hyderabad-based Ind-Barath Power Infra Ltd’s 700MW plant in Odisha. NLC, earlier known as Neyveli Lignite Corp. Ltd, will shortly hire two consultants—one each from the public and private sectors to carry out the due diligence, said Sarat Acharya, chairman and managing director, NLC India on the sidelines of  Global Natural Resources Conclave organized by Network18 and the Confederation of Indian Industry.The public sector unit plans to acquire 3,000MW of stressed power generation capacity, driven by its strategy of using the revenue generated from running such projects to finance capital expenditure. “Others had come as part of the process that we have been running for stressed power projects acquisition. We are also setting up a power generation capacity of 7,000MW, which will take around six years for commissioning. Acquiring such stressed projects will allow us to generate electricity and start cash flows,” Acharya added.<i>Mint</i> reported on 6 January about <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/0NqK8pYI3nre76AvaM8Q9K/NLC-India-may-acquire-IndBarath-power-plant.html"" target=""_blank"">NLC being in talks with Ind-Barath to acquire its coal-fired power plant in Odisha</a>.On 23 August, NLC India invited expressions of interest from firms owning coal- and lignite-based power plants of capacity of more than 2,00MW for possible acquisition.Across the country, thermal power projects totalling around 25,000MW are up for sale. Over the last few years, power companies have found it difficult to secure fuel supplies and buyers for the power they generate because debt-laden state electricity boards are unwilling to buy expensive power. Most power generators are weighed down by debt, forcing some of them to sell assets.NLC has already signed an agreement to acquire Damodar Valley Corp.’s (DVC) 1,200MW Raghunathpur project in West Bengal through a joint venture company (JVC) proposed to be formed with DVC, with an equity shareholding of 74:26 by NLC and DVC. However, the acquisition plans have been hanging fire due to opposition from the West Bengal government.While the Raghunathpur projects has got other clearances, we are still awaiting clearance from the West Bengal government, which has been stuck for six months, Acharya said.DVC, formed on the lines of the Tennessee Valley Authority in the US, is owned by the Union government and the state governments of West Bengal and Jharkhand. Experts believe consolidation is inevitable because power projects are stressed.“It is exciting to see power producers evaluating distressed assets and bringing forward their plans for capacity addition if the deal is priced right. It aligns to their competitive advantages like understanding of the region, availability of fuel source and capital, operational excellence and long-term sale of power. It also releases financial stress in the sector,” said Sambitosh Mohapatra, partner (energy) at PwC India.While a GMR spokesperson did not respond to queries emailed on Thursday evening, an Ind-Barath spokesperson confirmed the development and in a text message said, “Yes, NLC has shortlisted our Odisha plant and discussions are currently ongoing between the parties.”NLC India which has an installed power generation capacity of 4,301MW, also plans to set up 4,000MW of solar power projects and is in talks with states in order to draw up viable power purchase agreements for selling electricity to them.“We are developing a 630MW solar power plant in Tamil Nadu...We  have a capital expenditure plan of Rs1,24,000 crore (Rs1.24 trillion) to meet our 2025 target. We are also looking at developing lithium ion batteries which is under consideration of our research wing,” Acharya said.A host of state-owned firms such as Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd, NTPC Ltd and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd are chalking out clean energy strategies, encouraged by the opportunities offered by India’s solar power ambitions.

-0.25,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"" id=""U20342711151mrD"" style="" letter-spacing: 4; ;"">In his 2013 book <i>Zen Garden: Conversations</i> <i>With Pathmakers</i>, Subroto Bagchi, co-founder of IT firm Mindtree, recalls being tipped off about Shombit Sengupta ahead of their first meeting in 1999. “I was told that if you did not have a budget of a crore as consulting fee, you didn’t go to Shombit. But wait a minute. There was another condition—he had to like you!” he writes about the man who, he says, taught him “more about brands...than anyone else in my entire career”.The trouble, though, is that Sengupta no longer wants to talk about brands. At 63, the founder and creative strategist of Shining Consulting, responsible for the consumer interface makeover of companies such as Unilever, Nestlé, Procter &amp; Gamble, Rémy Martin, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Wipro and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, would rather concentrate on his art. It’s the reason why, after 40-odd years in France, he now prefers to spend 60% of his time in India. In Bengaluru, to be precise, where, many years ago, he bought a dilapidated transformer factory in Whitefield and redesigned it into an abode like no other. It’s tempting to see the house, split into two wings, as a metaphor for Sengupta’s own life, divided between France and India, brand design and art. <p id=""U20342711151g2"" style="" letter-spacing: -2; ;"">The two parts of the house are connected by a labyrinthine corridor; the walls have Sengupta’s own exuberant artworks while the floor space resembles a fairground, installed with the most dazzling collection of colourful Indian kitsch: shiny lip balms, glittery balls, skeins of crinkled cotton, stacks of glass bangles. It’s all a bit overwhelming.Like the man himself. Kitted out in a sheep-print shirt, his shock of hair still more pepper than salt, Sengupta demands attention as he talks. His story is so fantastic, it’s hard to look away but it does not do to merely follow his words: He needs total engagement. He responds in kind, listening actively and often stepping outside himself to call you out. As he does when his wife Renee Jhala, managing director of Shining Consulting—they met while he was consulting with Wipro, where she was head of public relations—wafts by: “She is making me talk about the brands,” he mock-complains about me, but acknowledges in the next breath that the success that followed his disruptive approach to design and branding allowed him to reboot his life as a sexagenarian to focus on art.“I went into business (as a brand consultant) to earn money,” Sengupta says without preamble. “And I stuck around for 35 years. Art has always informed my work. But I never delivered something that only looked good; my work made businesses look good.”Aesthetics, one might think, was not supposed to be the strong suit of a boy born in a camp for East Pakistan refugees in Kanchrapara, West Bengal. But early on, Sengupta developed an appreciation of his surroundings. If the Bengali Bengal was defined by poverty, the Victorian Bengal was embodied in the British-built residence of his schoolteacher-mother’s friend. In Chandannagar, a row or a swim across the Hooghly, he encountered a third Bengal, a French Bengal. His father, a committed Communist and anti-British activist, had French sympathies—he was a fan of the Vincent van Gogh biopic <i>Lust For Life</i>, which portrayed the Dutch artist’s flowering in Paris—and subtly communicated to the young boy that an art education, to be worthwhile, had to be French.And so it was that at the age of 19, only half-done with his course at the Government College of Art and Craft in what was still Calcutta, Sengupta bought himself a ticket to Paris for Rs2,700, the sale proceeds of his mother’s gold bangles. “I could barely speak English, let alone French,” says Sengupta, his English still thickly accented by Bengali. “But I had a skill in art and I was determined to develop it.”<p id=""U20342711151M0F"" style="" letter-spacing: -7; ;"">Though Sengupta went on to join École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts de Paris, the national school of fine arts, and then studied design at École Supérieure d’Arts Graphiques Penninghen, formal degrees were not his forte. Perpetually short of funds and compelled to send money home, Sengupta took up any work he could find, from sweeping floors to assisting lithographers. “Intelligence or leadership are not qualities you learn in school. Apprenticeship is very important. I was always drawn to writers, advocates, psychologists, performing artistes—that was the way I nurtured myself, how I learnt to converge different elements when it came to branding and design as well.”A considerable part of Sengupta’s success as a brand guru championing a “consumer connect” must be laid at the door of this carefully cultivated understanding of multiple disciplines. “Art was the only way I could earn. Yves Brayer, a famous artist I met at the lithographer’s, encouraged me to consider design communication. So I studied graphic design, applied art, photography, typography. But once in the field, I found I was completely different from everybody. Because of my multiple interests, areas of expertise and a humanist outlook, I made for a grand solutions provider. I can diagnose an ailing business the way a good doctor diagnoses a patient.<p id=""U203427111515b"" style="" letter-spacing: -5; ;"">“Also, my language was completely different,” Sengupta says. “So, if a chief executive officer came to me and said his product was ‘premium’, I would ask him, what’s premium about a consumer product? Affordability is a different issue but, by labelling yourself ‘premium’, you’re alienating a huge market.” His maverick approach included hanging out at a <i>kirana</i>, or neighbourhood grocery store, to figure out why large cooking-oil containers weren’t selling, and picking up the Britannia tag line <i>Eat Healthy, Think Better</i> from a Kolkata rickshaw-puller. Business magazines lavished pages on him, a colourful, plain-speaking break from the pinstriped politically correct. At its peak, the Shining client list read like the who’s who of the corporate world: Prominent among them were 3M, Dow Chemicals, Carrefour, Intermarché, Corning/Newell, Henkel, Nivea, L’Oréal, Pernod Ricard, Reckitt Benckiser, Galerie Lafayette-Monoprix, Total Petroleum internationally, and Reliance Retail, Madura Garments, Coffee Day, Jindal Steel &amp; Power in India. Of late, Sengupta has consciously cut down consulting engagements to a few select clients, mostly in Europe. But, out of the corner of his eye, he continues to pick up on trends and behaviours in the market. Pet among his peeves are Indian businesses that aim to be conglomerates rather than single-domain enterprises. “I give them 15-20 years, they won’t last beyond that,” he says. “Before the Tatas launched the Nano, I had said it wouldn’t work—and it didn’t. When businesses believe in one thing, they can nurture people, build expertise. I hope the new generation will follow that path. Take Airtel. (Sunil Bharti Mittal) tried a couple of other things but his focus was one. Infosys, too, has focused on one domain. “As for the young people working on start-ups, I always tell them, don’t go for start-ups—shorthand for make money and go away—go for build-ups. All businesses have always been start-ups. All this new language is totally nonsense!”In the second hour of our conversation, we are sitting at a worktable in his sprawling, double-height studio, with its curving walls and natural light. All around us are works old and new: Some acrylic-on-canvas frames from Sengupta’s 2016 <i>Night Spirit</i> series, depicting the owl in various mythologies; a few of the tiled <i>Désordre </i>installation series—first made in 2008—which viewers are invited to scramble like a jigsaw puzzle; multiple large canvases featuring a woman and a horse that gallerist Vickram Sethi places in a metaphysical/sexual lineage dating back to the legend of Lady Godiva. He last showed at the Institute of Contemporary Indian Art, Kala Ghoda, Mumbai, in November; a couple of exhibitions are lined up in Europe later this year. For all the workload, art has always been a mainstay for Sengupta. “Art was the foundation of my work,” he says simply, when I ask him how he juggled the two (he was also a weekly columnist for <i>The Indian Express</i> between 2009-14, and is the author of the <i>Jalebi </i>trilogy, on managing businesses in India). “I don’t sleep for more than 4-5 hours a day. Only between 1978-84 did art take a back seat, because I was setting up Shining. But even then, my sketchbook never left my side.“Around 1994, I realized it was important for an artist to develop his own school of thought. That’s when I came up with the concept of Gesturism, basing it on a professor’s early appreciation of the kinetic energy in my works. My style changed completely after that. But Renee pointed out that my art was too Cartesian (after René Descartes, whose philosophy was the bedrock of continental rationalism), too European. I needed to re-root myself in India to define my identity, unite my French inspiration and sense of structure with the non-dogmatic, indisciplined way India uses colour. A third factor was my examination of the <i>désordre—</i>disorder in the French sense, related to physical objects—in India.”In a life so packed with activity, art and accolades, turning 60 was a milestone. “Renee pushed me to devote more time to art at that juncture,” says Sengupta. “Fine art is pre-civilizational; design is a post-industrialization phenomenon, aiming to satisfy a human need, stated or unstated. Art, on the other hand, is completely individual; it needs no other justification.” As we wind down our conversation, the canvases around us look on. Each of them bears the flamboyant Sen signature: The artist prefers to use a truncated version of the family name for his work. Interestingly, his son from his first marriage, too, shortened his name Saikat to Shoi. As Shoi Sen, marketing man-turned-lead guitarist for British band De Profundis, he opened for Iron Maiden in Bengaluru in 2009.

0.46,"Two sets of findings, related to societal trust levels, in a report released last week at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, should be a cause of grave concern to all of us. Part of a study released by communications group Edelman, the survey of more than 33,000 people in 28 countries including India, recorded the largest-ever drop of trust in business, government, the media, and non-government organisations (NGOs).Corporate chief executive officers (CEOs), whose credibility level dropped in each of the countries surveyed, were aggressively targeted with only 37% of people saying they trusted them.The 12-point drop from the previous year is the all-time low since the survey began in 2001. This isn’t the first time the corporate sector has been reminded of declining people’s trust. Last January, Young &amp; Rubicam BrandAsset Valuator revealed that consumers’ trust in well-known brands continues to fall.ALSO READ | <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/Ha2BoiGBuhhMKyueDZiIoJ/What-global-CEOs-are-watching-for.html"" target=""_blank"">What global CEOs are watching for, according to a PwC survey</a>Strangely, you would think that CEOs reputation for trust would have taken a hit from the work of the media. But that institution didn’t fare too well either with 43% of the respondents expressing trust in the press, down from 48% the year before. So if people’s falling trust in company executives isn’t driven by the reports in traditional media, where is the angst coming from? Perhaps there’s a third force now that might be responsible for generating the ire and that’s the social media, the new watchdog for corporate wrongdoing.Edelman CEO Richard Edelman, speaking at the WE, linked this to the sky-high compensation levels of top CEOs as well as the fact that employees were disappointed their leaders were not helping them deal with automation and the changing business environment. These changes have led to a rash of lay-offs in recent times with companies as diverse as Oracle Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Microsoft Corp. trimming their work forces.ALSO READ | <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/kAVLUpKPL17lPFrTz0QoNP/Of-founders-and-CEOs.html"" target=""_blank"">Of founders and CEOs</a>In India, close on the heels of the controversy last year when several well-funded start-ups rolled back offers made to fresh graduates from engineering schools, comes the news this year of large scale sackings.

Business analysts have frequently proved that there is a direct correlation between growth and trust.ALSO READ | <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Politics/p9NcUzDxBFMkPqoOefFcSI/Optimism-reigns-in-India-as-CEOs-consumers-look-beyond-Chin.html"" target=""_blank"">Optimism reigns in India as CEOs, consumers look beyond China</a>American behavioural economist and psychiatrist Richard L. Peterson and sports consultant Frank Murtha noted in 2008 after the financial crisis: “Trust is the oil in the engine of capitalism, without it, the engine seizes up. Confidence is like the gasoline, without it the machine won’t move.”Part of the reason for the increasing trust deficit is of course the overall culture of lower deference towards authority figures and institutions. But that isn’t all of it. In 2016, for instance, Volkswagen AG CEO Martin Winterkorn’s resigned following the emissions scandal, Fox News CEO Roger Ailes lost his job following a sexual harassment charge, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch became a public enemy when she trebled prices of life-saving injection EpiPen, and Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf came under fire for refusing to take personal responsibility when his bank was caught creating two million fake accounts. Closer home, Vijay Mallya took employees, shareholders and bankers for a right royal ride before flying to the UK as creditors closed in on him.The resulting trust deficit has had several disastrous consequences. Corporate loyalty is fast going the way of the dinosaur. As employees feel free to change jobs at will, this has led to mounting costs of hiring and training besides a struggle to build team spirit and group dynamics. Externally, there is a lower threshold level of tolerance for any slippage in corporate performance. One quarter of declining numbers and stakeholders start demanding changes either in terms of management or worse still, strategy.Corporate trust deficit is a two-way street. It indicates that employees, customers, and company watchers have problems believing what its top executives say. But equally it also indicates that the company itself is in some kind of trouble.<i>Sundeep Khanna is a consulting editor at Mint and oversees the newsroom’s corporate coverage.

Indus OS, which is available in 12 Indian regional languages, boasts innovative features such as Indus Swipe (translation from English to a regional language and vice versa with just a swipe), Indus Keyboard (with built-in word and matra (a unit of metrical quantity in Indian languages) prediction) and Indus Reader (which can convert an English text into audio in eight regional languages). Besides, there’s a marketplace called App Bazaar, where over 50,000 apps are available in local languages.Dongre recalls one of his foreign trips when his lack of understanding of the local language made him feel handicapped: “Everything around me was in a language I did not understand.” Dongre also realized how digitally less connected the Indian heartland is and how alien English is to a lot of Indians. “After spending some more time to understand the Indian digital landscape and brainstorming with my team, we decided to start building an ecosystem for Indian consumers.” The team built Indus OS on three core pillars: simplicity, innovation and localization. “At the heart of our story lies the desire to equip anyone who is using a smartphone with a holistic ecosystem of their choice,” says Dongre.Indus OS, which introduced Indus OS 2.0 in July 2016, will introduce Indus OS 3.0 in 2017. “In 2017, we intend to continue to work with the Government of India and app developers alike to build a smartphone ecosystem of choice for the emerging markets population,” Dongre says.Ankit JhanwarOrganization: Pluss Advanced TechnologiesDesignation: Vice-president, corporate planning and strategyInnovation: A packaging box for vaccine transportation that uses phase change materials and a unique design for precise temperature controlEducation: BTech in polymer science and technology from IIT Roorkee; certificate in entrepreneurship, management and global leadership from London School of Economics and Political ScienceAn optimist by nature, Ankit Jhanwar was not put off by the disinterest displayed by some packaging companies in developing a temperature-controlled shipping solution using phase change materials (PCMs)—a domain in which his company, Pluss Advanced Technologies, had been working since 2005. Such a temperature-controlled solution could prove very useful in cutting down the 30% wastage of vaccines in the existing cold chain system in the country. So what Pluss did was develop a complete shipping solution using its own proprietary PCMs, which could not only provide better temperature control but also address the challenging Indian ambient conditions of 40°C. “A range of products were planned to address the gaps at each leg of the supply chain right from manufacturer to the depot to the distributor to chemist and finally to the patient,” says Jhanwar.The shipping solution that he developed was branded Celsure—which uses the PCM technology to provide precise temperature control. “It is the only shipping solution which provides temperature control for more than 72 hours even at ambient temperature of 40°C,” he says. Thanks to this innovation, all the current pharmaceutical shipments which happen by air can now be done by road using Celsure—something that can lead to huge savings in freight cost, thereby making it possible to lower the prices of medicines.According to Jhanwar, Celsure also addresses the unique challenge of shipping from a hot environment (say, India) to a cold environment (like Europe) or vice versa. What’s more, the solution has brought in simplicity in the packaging, removing human errors. Jhanwar says that it’s available in sizes as small as one vial to as large as 10,000 vials and can provide temperature control for as low as 2 hours to as high as 120 hours. Pluss has a goal of reducing medicine wastage due to ineffective cold chain to as low as 0.1% in the next three-five years. The firm is constantly working on scaling up and commercializing the innovation. Celsure was launched in April 2016 with only one variant; eight more variants have been added within a year. Logistics firms such as Blue Dart and DHL have adopted Celsure as one of their preferred modes of shipping temperature-sensitive pharma products. Successful trials have also been run with various pharmaceutical firms. Besides commercializing it in India, Pluss plans to go global with the launch in Singapore and the Middle East in 2018 and in the US and Europe in 2019. “We are also keen on tie-ups with the government, World Health Organization (WHO), Unicef and other related organizations for last-mile delivery of vaccines. Customized products are being planned to address the last mile challenges,” says Jhanwar. Anusha RammohanOrganization: General Electric Global ResearchDesignation: Lead engineerInnovation: Flow analytics for multi-phase flow metering in oil and gas industryEducation: BE (Hons.) in electronics and instrumentation from BITS-Pilani; MS in electrical engineering from Arizona State University, USAnusha Rammohan believes that the intersection of the digital and physical worlds is the ideal space for disruptive innovations. And that’s exactly what attracted her to the esoteric domain of flow analytics for multi-phase flow metering in the oil and gas industry.As the lead engineer at GE Global Research’s John F Welch Technology Center in Bengaluru, Anusha got the opportunity to combine physical sensors with advanced analytics to develop a solution capable of radically transforming the processes of the entire industry. “As the global energy demand continues to increase, there is an urgent need in the oil and gas industry to be more efficient with resources, people and investments to reduce the cost of producing oil while doing so safely with reduced environmental impact,” says Rammohan. Her innovation addresses this need by combining sensor and device data in the field using intelligent analytics to provide accurate and reliable information in real time about oil production. For instance, she says, timely information about well and field level production of oil, water and gas allows operators to make critical decisions related to optimizing pumps, allocating resources and energy to each well, shutting down or stimulating wells, and preventing leakage and blockage of pipes, etc. By transforming data into actionable insights, her analytics solution enables increased oil recovery, reduced human intervention and improved resource planning.Not merely restricting her innovation to a single industry, the next stop for Anusha is to extend it to applications in industries such as aviation, power and transportation. The applications include performance optimization of assets, health monitoring of safety-critical components and their increased reliability and reduced downtime—all of which can significantly improve productivity and bring down costs. Rammohan has been granted patents related to her work in image mapping, sensor positioning and flow measurement; she has filed for more. She dreams of a world powered by analytics and technologies such as artificial intelligence—one in which “autonomous decision making” would greatly reduce the ambiguity, uncertainty and human subjectivity that are currently proving to be bottlenecks in all industries.<p id=""U20332513080DkE"" style="" text-indent: 0; ;"">Kshitij Marwah<p id=""U20332513080mXC"" style="" text-indent: 0; ;"">Organization: Tesseract Imaging<p id=""U20312879031EJ"" style="" text-indent: 0; ;"">Designation: Founder<p id=""U20312879031KfE"" style="" text-indent: 0; ;"">Innovation: Virtual reality (VR) camera to create and share high resolution VR/holographic content; holographic augmented reality headset<p id=""U20312879031SEC"" style="" text-indent: 0; ;"">Education: MTech in computer science from IIT Delhi; MS in media arts and sciences from MIT Media Lab, Massachusetts, US<p class=""S3l"">Kshitij Marwah says virtual reality and augmented reality (VR and AR) are the new mediums for human beings to tell their stories in a much more “experiential and immersive manner”. It marks a natural progression, as he says:  “From the spoken word to the written word, from photos to videos—we have always found new ways and tools to tell our stories.”The power of his belief in VR and AR, backed by the rigour of his technical education (never mind that he dropped out of his PhD at MIT Media Lab), led Marwah to his innovations: Quark VR camera and the Holoboard AR viewing headset. Says he, “The Quark VR camera will democratize mixed reality content creation and the Holoboard AR headset will allow for its viewing in a truly immersive and unique manner.”Marwah has a simple way of explaining his innovation. “Imagine the next time when you are watching a cricket match in your house. Rather than sitting in front of your television, with our Quark camera streaming the match live in VR and the Holoboard headset, you can feel as if you are sitting right in the stadium but in the comfort of your couch,” he says.His current company, Tesseract Imaging (in Norse mythology, Tesseract is said to be a cosmic cube of immense power; in geometry, the tesseract is a four-dimensional hypercube), was spun out of MIT Media Lab’s India arm, a unit that Marwah had co-founded to promote and spread inter-disciplinary learning among students in India. He is credited with growing the Lab initiative from a platform of 50 students to 500 students selected from hundreds of thousands of applicants across the country. He headed the India arm of the Lab from 2012 to 2015.Marwah believes that the innovations coming out of Tesseract will revolutionize “the way we capture, consume and see content and media”. On the anvil are plans to begin shipping the Quark VR cameras in mid-2017 and Holoboard AR headsets by the end of the year. “With our technology, we believe we can make sure that our society can capture, share and consume their daily experiences and share stories across generations with an experience that is immersive and powerful.”Nishant KumarOrganization: Embryyo Technologies Pvt. LtdDesignation: Founder and CEOInnovation: Sensor and mobile app-based drug adherence monitoring system for tuberculosisEducation: Dual degree in mechanical engineering from IIT Bombay Nishant Kumar, the founder and chief exec of Embryyo Technologies, a medical technology and research start-up incubated at Pune’s Venture Centre, was troubled by the way tuberculosis (TB) treatment was left midway by a large number of patients in India. There wasn’t an effective way of ensuring patients stayed the course. “This was because the TB medication involves a drug regimen of about 6 months where the patient is required to take a total of about 400 pills,” he says. There are several reasons why treatment is left incomplete, including side effects, forgetfulness, poor counselling and duration of the regimen. The enormity of the problem—as many as 2.5 million people in India were affected by TB in 2015 as per a World Health Organization report—inspired Kumar to do something about it. He visited the local district level hospitals and direct observation treatment (DOT) centres to interact with the clinicians, healthcare workers and patients, which helped him in “collecting more insights” and further strengthened his resolve to address this problem. He says that it demanded an easy-to-use, affordable solution which could fit seamlessly in an already established public health infrastructure in the country. The result was BoxRx, an electronic medical event monitoring system that has currently been piloted for drug adherence monitoring in TB patients. According to Kumar, most people with TB are cured by a strictly followed, six-month drug regimen but any interruption to it can cause drug resistance.That is where the innovation behind BoxRx comes in handy. The solution comprises a specially designed electronic pill box which carries the TB blister pack as prescribed by the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP). A tearable paper with conductive ink tracks printed corresponding to each pill is placed beneath the blister pack before closing the box. Whenever a pill is removed from the blister pack, the conductive track gets broken and this activity is logged and transmitted from an in-built Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) circuit to a central server in the form of an SMS. The server processes the information in the SMS and updates the mobile application of the doctor/health worker assigned to that particular patient.To scale up the innovation, Kumar plans to work very closely with the national and international organizations that are leading the TB control programmes. Also on the cards is large-scale manufacturing and on-field implementation of the innovation so that it reaches the maximum number of patients. Kumar envisions a society that is centred on harmonious and sustainable co-existence. “I believe that good health is the primary signature of prosperity for an individual, a family, a nation and the world at large,” he says.Pankaj AgarwalDesignation: Creative leaderOrganization: Samsung ElectronicsInnovation: A button-type device that connects to toys and a mobile app to enable intuitive interactions for kidsEducation: BTech in electrical engineering from IIT Kanpur; MS from Seoul National University; MBA from Harvard Business SchoolWhenever Pankaj Agarwal saw his son Anant play alone with his toy blocks, a question often nagged him: “Why does he have to play alone? Is there something I can do to make play-at-home social and interactive for him?” He was also inspired to change the status quo when he looked at the many expensive toys gathering dust around his house. Agarwal thought of the millions of middle-class homes that just couldn’t afford all those high-tech toys with pricey tags.So he added a simple and interactive, yet relatively inexpensive, tag of his own: TagPlus. The innovation comprises a button-type smart tag, a smart app (for phones/tablets), and, above all, content created and shared in the cloud by kids as young as 7-year-olds. A key benefit of TagPlus is that it can increase the repeat play value of toys. An important feature of the innovation, says Agarwal, is that there is no set-up required. “No device pairing, no logins, no passwords!” When kids buy toys that have this smart tag, they can start playing on the TagPlus platform immediately after unwrapping it. Kids can “click”, “long press”, “shake” and “bump” their smart tags and the smart app will respond accordingly. A “click” on the smart tag activates the TagPlus app on a nearby digital device to show toy-related content. A “long press” action will bring on a social media interface where kids can easily upload their creations and also see the creations of other kids playing with the same toy. “Think of this as a ‘mini Facebook for kids’,” says Agarwal. A “shake” action on the smart tag will help kids find and connect with children playing with an identical toy who could be anywhere in the world. Also, when kids “bump” two tags from two different toys, the connected app shows multiple ways in which the toys can be combined to create something entirely new. Agarwal and his other TagPlus team members at Samsung believe that this patent-pending technology platform has the potential to make kids’ playing experiences more serendipitous, socially engaging and creative “by seamlessly bridging their virtual and physical play environments”. Agarwal and his colleagues did multiple pilot tests of TagPlus in South Korea and they are also in discussion with many toy makers to adopt the platform. “The response has been very positive,” he says. Agarwal plans to continue his innovative work in the creative domain and believes that “members of our society should be educated and imbibe a culture of creativity”.Prasant MisraDesignation: ScientistOrganization: TCS Research and Innovation, Tata Consultancy Services LtdInnovation: Auditory sensing for micro unmanned aerial vehicles Education: PhD in computer science and engineering from the University of New South Wales, Sydney; postdoctoral fellowship from the Swedish Institute of Computer Science, StockholmPrasant Misra has been focusing his research efforts around building “spatially intelligent systems”. His current work pertains to the auditory sensing technology for micro unmanned aerial vehicles (MUAVs, more popularly known as drones). It’s like “growing the ears” for intelligent things, as he puts it. “It is part of a grand vision to equip this category of flying robots with a sensory gamut that is on par with humans,” he says. This will not only enable such “things” to derive better spatial intelligence, but also drive cognition to a better level of autonomy by combining auditory sensing with vision.There are, however, fundamental challenges in developing such robust auditory capabilities, especially in capturing the spatial dimensions of a sound scene and analysing its acoustic signature. “The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio is extremely low due to the presence of (near-field) wideband acoustic interference (i.e., self-noise) from the MUAVs’ spinning rotors and motors, which is both strong and non-stationary,” he explains. Theoretically speaking, building an acoustic array with a large number of acoustic elements can overcome such high levels of noise, but the space, payload and energy limitations of an MUAV come in the way of meeting such exhaustive system requirements and computational needs.Misra is now investigating both lightweight acoustic sensing system design, and low-power (but efficient) computation paradigms to overcome this challenge. The initial results, he says, are quite promising.The impact of the work Misra is doing is far-reaching. It will not only force us to rethink the current model of aerial sensing (which is primarily vision dominated), but will also open up newer applications and usage scenarios for the betterment of society. It is now quite common to talk of aerial drones, especially tiny ones with multiple rotors that can hover mid-air, in applications ranging from e-commerce deliveries and inspection of industrial machinery to wildlife monitoring and search-and-rescue operations. Nevertheless, their sensing technology is predominately vision-centric. “While the advantages are clearly obvious in visual inspection and monitoring applications, on the flip side, they become unusable in camera-obstructed or low-light conditions, or in scenarios that offer non-visual clues such as those based on sound. In fact, these conditions are a norm in high-stress environments (dense canopy or fog, structures on fire, underground mines, etc.),” he says.Misra is working towards taking the MUAV technology from its existing level to “cognitive autonomous systems”. He believes that as spatial intelligence and cognitive technology mature, the lines between machines and humans would blur, enabling both to live together in the same society as companions. In the future, cognitive aerial drones will take up roles such as aerial cars and taxis, pick up and escort agents, search and rescue bots, and ears and eyes for the disabled. In short: anything you want them to be.Sandeep Senan Designation: Founder and directorOrganization: Evobi Automations Pvt. Ltd (Bibox Labs)Innovation: A toolkit-based approach to learning so that kids can learn through experiments by making things like a robotic toy or a fire alarmEducation: BE in computer science from Visvesvaraya Technological University, Karnataka; MBA in international business from Edith Cowan University, AustraliaWhen it comes to innovation and creativity, Sandeep Senan is as excited as the young kids he wants to empower with the innovative tools at his disposal. His innovation, Bibox (short for Brain-in-a-box), is like an “electronic brain which can be instructed by a kid using a graphical software, which can run on a tablet or smartphone or PC or even with cards”, he says. Senan is of the view that the realm of innovation must be extended to children rather than remain mostly confined to the adult world. There’s a need for a huge change in the way children are taught and allowed to be creative, he feels.“The task of making adults creative is a humongous task, but if we think about kids, they are naturally curious and thus it’s easy to instill an innovative thinking process in them,” says Senan. So when he discovered that there was a lack of tools and curricula designed for instilling the habit of innovation in kids, he decided to do something about it.“The innovation Bibox was originated out of that need to give kids the tools to change the world and thus the confidence to keep innovating and make it a habit so that when they become adults, they can go out and make large-scale impact because the thinking is ingrained into their minds,” he says.Bibox doesn’t have a definite shape or size but is basically a set of tools—processors, switches, sensors, battery and software, among others—using which children in different age groups can try their hand at innovation. This “brain”, says Senan, can be connected to a variety of accessories, including toys, lights and TV sets, and children can come up with stuff like walking robotic dogs, automatic TV and even connected health products using the Internet of Things.“Because Bibox responds to kids’ logic in the physical world, they can see what the logic means and correct themselves when required—making the learning experience truly experiential,” he says. Besides providing them such toolkits, Senan’s organization also provides them some structured mentoring to enable them to use their creative freedom and confidence to innovate more and more in any field they choose to be in. “We are just getting the process started a little early,” he says. Through Bibox Labs, he has enrolled more than 25,000 students in over 100 schools in India.To take his innovative ways to a much larger base of students, Senan and his team are digitizing the process of mentoring the kids to be innovators. Once this is in place, he says, any student anywhere in the world would be able to go through the same process that Bibox Labs follows in its affiliate schools. They also plan to partner with private firms, non-governmental organizations and various government bodies to scale up the programme.Subham Banerjee Designation: Young scientistOrganization: Centre for Biodesign and Diagnostic, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, department of biotechnologyInnovation: Transdermal patch against neurotoxin poisoningEducation: Master of pharmacy from West Bengal University of Technology; PhD in pharmacy from Birla Institute of Technology, MesraSoldiers fighting in hostile territories often have to shield themselves against harmful or poisonous gases and chemical substances. One often hears of deadly strikes such as the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system (1995), the nerve gas attack in Syria (2013) or the recent attack in Iraq by Islamic State militants in which they set fire to a sulphur mine, spreading sulphur dioxide plumes.Subham Banerjee’s innovation concerns protecting people against neurotoxic poisoning resulting from such attacks. “The exposure of humans to neurotoxins is a major risk factor in severe mortality in chemical or biological warfare situations, as neurotoxins are one of the most potent toxins,” he says. His innovation, a transdermal patch that can provide protection against neurotoxin poisoning, comprises an inert adhesive matrix system with active pharmaceutical ingredients. The patch can be applied to intact or even burnt or blistered skin. It works by releasing a combination drug (eserine and pralidoxime chloride) through the skin in what is called a “controlled or sustained release” mechanism.According to Banerjee, the new patch has “an excellent safety profile”, can be “self-administered”, and has positive environmental as well as economic impact. “Apart from conventional dosage forms, no novel sustained release prophylactic transdermal patches are currently available in the market,” he says. Which is why this innovation has huge socio-economic benefits and the potential to achieve product dominance in the market.In order to sustain this project and take it to the next level of successful commercialization, however, Banerjee says that some studies have to be carried out. For one, process parameters have to be optimized to scale up the capability of manufacturing these patches in bulk quantities. Also, a preclinical toxicity study in rodents needs to be done, followed by a full-fledged pilot for the bioavailability study in human subjects as per the guidelines of the Drug Controller General of India.Banerjee believes that this innovation has the potential to make an “extra value-addition” to the existing measures for biological warfare protection available with India’s Armed Forces.Vinay Kumar Designation: Co-founder, director and CEOOrganization: PathShodh Healthcare Pvt. LtdInnovation: A single device that can diagnose multiple parameters related to diabetes managementEducation: MTech in microelectronics and VLSI design and MSc in electronic science from Kurukshetra University; PhD from Centre for Nano Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Science BangaloreAt age 14, when Vinay Kumar was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes, his doctor told him he would have to take insulin injections. The look of disappointment on his face prompted the physician to lie that it was only for 10 days that injections were needed. Later on, when Kumar realized that he was stuck with the needle for a lifetime, he became determined to put the hurt and discomfort behind and do something about it. Over the years, diabetes took a bigger and bigger toll on his body, with episodes of hypoglycemia (abnormally low level of sugar in the blood) and even fainting—but all this only strengthened his resolve.In addition to struggling with a debilitating condition like millions in the world do, Kumar constantly thought about how a diabetic can manage his condition better and, at the same time, persisted with his studies. “These two aspects of my life merged when I decided to pursue a PhD at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc Bangalore),” he says. Besides working on novel ways to diagnose diseases and acquiring multiple patents, he also co-founded (along with Navakanta Bhat and Gautam Sharma) PathShodh Healthcare Pvt. Ltd, a start-up incubated at IISc that is focused on medical device research and development.Kumar’s innovation is a hand-held point-of-care device which, as a single unit, can measure eight different parameters related to diabetes management and early detection of its complications. “With a tiny drop of finger-pricked blood samples, patients can test HbA1c (which gives 90 days blood glucose control profile), glycated albumin (which gives 15 days blood glucose control profile) and instant blood glucose as well,” he says. The device can detect very early damage in the kidney by measuring the microalbuminuria, creatinine and ACR (albumin to creatinine ratio) in the urine samples. Apart from these, he adds, it can measure the haemoglobin level for anaemia and chronic kidney disease. “The device can measure serum albumin, an important blood marker for kidney and liver. So the single device can take care of full diabetes glycaemic management and early detection of complications such as diabetic nephropathy,” explains Kumar.The road ahead for PathShodh is well-defined. “The device is ready and regress clinical validation for most of the tests has been completed on real patient samples in collaboration with major pathology labs and hospitals in Bangalore. We also have the manufacturing line setup at IISc to manufacture the disposable test strips for these different tests,” says Kumar. The commercial launch of the device can happen any time now. That would certainly move the needle in a positive direction for PathShodh’s mission of making healthcare diagnostics affordable and available to all.",2017-03-31,Meet the 10 winners of the Mint-MIT Technology Review competition for innovators below the age of 35 from across India in different cutting-edge domains,company,17:26,EmTech 2017: Innovators under 35
-0.43,"Charlottesville,US: To transform India’s economy, there is a need to reduce “friction” in businesses and create an “environment” wherein the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs, Infosys founder N. R. Narayana Murthy has said. For the transformation of the Indian economy, he said it is essential for the younger generation to be daring and that India is integrated with the global economy. “We still have a little bit of work in reducing friction to businesses. We need to create an environment where the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs than it is today,” Murthy, 70, told students of the prestigious Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia here. Murthy, the recipient of the 2017 Thomas Jefferson Foundation medal in Global Innovation, was responding to Darden School of Business Dean Scott Beardsley who asked, “what do you think needs to happen next to transform India’s economy. What is next”.

We have to become much more integrated to the world economy so that we can consider the entire world as our market and can become globally competitive. “And most importantly we can become much more open minded to learn from the wonderful things that are happening in this country and elsewhere. I would say these are required (for transforming India’s economy to the next level),” Murthy said. He, however, refrained from elaborating what the Indian government needs to do to create the environment of trust in its entrepreneurs and said, “I will tell you why, as an Indian citizen, it may not be proper if I were to be critical about India when I am outside India”. Interacting with students, he said, challenges for entrepreneurs are now different than the time when he started Infosys. Those days access to capital was almost non-existent and government was a big irritant. “Today, challenges are different. But in some sense even more complex, because today’s entrepreneurs have to be much more smarter than what we were because there is so much of competition on a global scale. Before you can say this can be done, somebody else may have already done it.” “Therefore, today’s entrepreneurs would have to be much more nimble, global, competitive because market is truly determinant for success today unlike our time when managing government was a big determinant in India,” he said. Murthy said good governance is all about maximising shareholders’ value while ensuring fairness, transparency and accountability to all stake holders. Of all the stakeholders, society is the most important player. “Respect from the society is the most important ingredient for longevity of a corporation,” he said. “To be honoured by the most innovative country in the world and to be awarded a medal in the name of Thomas Jefferson, author of Declaration of Independence is to me a big honour. I will certainly work hard, and hopefully smart in the remaining years of my life, to deserve this kindness, this generosity and this affection on their part,” he told <i>PTI</i>. The fact that the university has seen it fit to pick up somebody from India, and bestow this honour shows how open this country is and how generous they are, Murthy said. “Therefore this is a clear example of how Indian students wherever they are whether in India or here or anywhere else can be sure that as long as they are good citizens of this world, contribute to make the society a better place through peaceful and harmonious methods, they will be recognised, appreciated,” he said. Murthy said that Indian students are making a positive impact in the countries they are studying. “I have not come across a single person of Indian-origin who has conducted himself or herself in a manner that has brought sorrow to the society they are living in, anywhere, wherever in the world. So I think that is the right way. “I am very very proud of our Indian students. They are smart, have very good values and are very peaceful. They contribute to the society in a very significant way wherever they are. I just want them to continue to do this,” the Infosys founder said. The one important principle that Indian students should remember in everything they do is will this make India a more respected place, a more respected nation? Will this action of mine make me a better part of this community? Will this action deserve appreciation and affection from other members in this community? If they remember these then they will do everything possible, Murthy said.

-0.44,"Bengaluru: For Vishal Sikka, 2016-17 stands as a rebuke.After three consecutive downward growth revisions, Infosys’s dollar revenue growth in the year ended 31 March 2017 will be at best 7.6%, 150 basis points (bps) lower than the 9.1% growth in 2015-16, and 620 bps short of its first projected 13.8% growth outlined in April last year. One bps is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Departure of four executive vice-presidents (EVP) in financial year 2017 (in addition to four EVP exits between August 2014 and March 2016) implies that Sikka continues to struggle to build a stable top leadership team. Further, Infosys continues to look away from acquisitions (it’s been 18 months since the company made its last acquisition), which makes one wonder what Houdini trick the management has to achieve its target of becoming a $20 billion firm by March 2021.Also read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/SqNSGmPTIfX68gCBjJSgdL/Will-corporate-earnings-disappoint-once-again.html"" target=""_blank"">Will corporate earnings disappoint once again?</a>Finally, Infosys founder N.R.Narayana Murthy’s outburst, twice in public, against some of the decisions by the board is another painful blow to Sikka. Agreed, Murthy has not questioned Sikka directly. But few of these decisions, including agreeing to a generous severance money to its former CFO (chief financial officer), and giving a hike to the current COO (chief operating officer), were approved by the management, and so it is naive to conclude that all is okay between Sikka and Murthy.Understandably, these developments have unnerved shareholders: in full fiscal year 2017, Infosys shares declined 16.2%, more than the 9% fall by BSE IT index, even as the benchmark Sensex index returned 17% gains. For these reasons, business historians would take note of the fall in Sikka’s popularity: from being hailed as a hero in the first 18 months, Sikka now battles allegations of skulduggery and corporate greed.So what can Sikka—and Infosys—do to possibly break this impasse?First, get back growth and improve its execution. A related second measure is to get some growth from three divisions: Infosys BPO, EdgeVerve, the products and platforms unit (together bring about 13% of revenue), and Infosys Consulting. Infosys needs to improve its ability to sell more solutions from these three services to its clients. Lastly, Sikka needs to arrest senior management departures and build a stable leadership team. All this needs to be done swiftly, and once completed, hopefully, any corporate governance concerns of shareholders (including the founders) should be assuaged. It is important to note here that the displeasure expressed by some of the founders against the board only coincided with the period when Infosys’s growth started slipping (during the first quarter of last year).Significantly, Sikka’s $8 million performance-related pay as part of his $11 million compensation is a thorny issue, and how the board justifies this variable salary to its CEO on Thursday will dictate if there is a third instance of public spat between Murthy and the board. Is all this doable? Unlikely.Simply, because for IT services firms, chasing reclusive growth is more challenging than ever. Moreover, in case of Infosys, nothing short of a miracle can bring back peace between some of the founders and the board and management. With this as a backdrop, <i>Mint </i>puts the spotlight on five things to watch in Infosys’s fourth quarter earnings on Thursday:Revenue forecast: Brokerage firm BNP Paribas sees Infosys recording 1.3% sequential increase in revenue at $2.58 billion for the January-March period. The Infosys management will be mindful that this growth will be 30 basis points less than what the company did in January-March last year. Analysts term the growth in the fourth quarter as “exit rate” and a strong growth helps to start on a good note in the new financial year. Again, management commentary for the April-June period will be crucial.Will Infosys give full-year guidance? For Infosys, providing a growth outlook is one decision which appears to be going down the wire. Analysts believe the management will give a growth outlook. Based on conversations with executives familiar with the development, this paper thinks otherwise and Infosys may discontinue from this practice. The board will eventually take a call when it meets on 12 and 13 April but this decision will decide the road ahead for the Infosys stock. Performance of top customers: During the second and third quarters, Infosys’s largest client and top five and top 10 clients gave less business to the company. Until the June quarter of last year, Sikka did well to get more business from its largest clients. Since Infosys gets a fifth of total revenue from its top 10 clients, the management needs to reverse this decline if Infosys expects to record sustainable growth. A rain-check on Infosys’s new initiatives in the wake of President Trump’s strict visa laws: Over the last 33 months, Sikka has steered Infosys to embrace newer ways to do business, such as by bringing elements of user-centric method of Design Thinking. At the same time, Infosys has increased its focus on building platforms, in an effort to move away from people-led model of doing business. All these measures will be tested as US President Donald Trump works to have a strict policy in place which makes it arduous for outsourcing companies to bring engineers in the US. Hence, commentary on how Infosys is monetising its platforms business and impact of changes in visa will be eyed.Weak areas: Sikka has been unable to get respectable growth from EdgeVerve and Infosys BPO in his near three-year stint at Infosys. Another disappointment has been that the consulting division too ran into trouble in April last year. Infosys has put in a new leadership team at all three units over the last year, and management commentary on how soon it expects growth from these three units should decide the overall growth for the company.",2017-04-13,"Infosys founders spat, Donald Trump’s US visa policy and three consecutive downward growth revisions are likely to weigh in on the Q4 results to be declared today",competitor,05:04,Infosys results today: Five things to watch out for
0.15,"San Francisco: Personal computer shipments notched their first quarterly growth in five years, researcher IDC said, though the gain of less than 1% from a year earlier underscored persistent weakness in demand, especially from consumers.Shipments totalled 60.3 million units in the first three months of the year, compared with 59.9 million in the same period a year earlier, IDC said Tuesday in a statement. It marked the first increase since the first quarter of 2012, IDC said.Gartner Inc., another major tracker of PCs, reported a decline of 2.4% for first-quarter global shipments. Both research companies said the business market for PCs had improved though not enough to offset a decline in consumer customers.Sales of desktop and laptop computers have been in decline as consumer demand shifted to smartphones and tablets for easily checking email or the internet on the go. Now the industry is counting on more interest in its machines from businesses and consumers wanting to replace aging hardware with sleeker and more powerful products that feature upgraded software. IDC and Gartner use their own methods for counting shipments in these reports, which are preliminary. Gartner, for example, includes desktops, notebooks and related devices such as Microsoft Corporation’s Surface, but not Google’s Chromebook. IDC includes Chromebooks, but not the Surface in this report, according to Jay Chou, research manager at IDC.The major brands in the industry all posted market share gains. HP retook the top spot with 22% in the first quarter, up from 19% a year earlier, IDC said. China-based Lenovo Group Ltd. posted a smaller uptick to 20.4% and Dell Technologies had 16%. Apple rose to 7% from 6.7%.Gartner puts Lenovo at number 1 with HP at number 2. Dell grabbed the number 3 spot, while Apple was number 5.Prices are climbing as key memory components get more expensive amid a shortage in the industry, according to Mikako Kitagawa, an analyst at Gartner. This doesn’t bode well for PC makers.“The price hike will suppress PC demand even further in the consumer market, discouraging buyers away from PC purchases unless it is absolutely necessary,” Kitagawa said in the statement. “The price hike started affecting the market in 1Q17.”In the US, Gartner said shipments fell 2.4%, with consumer demand dragging down sales. HP was number 1 in the US market, while Dell was number 2. Apple was number 4.

-0.53,"Hyderabad: The tightening of H1B work visa rules in the US would be advantageous to Indian IT firms as they would shift more work offshore and also be in a position to improve their billing rate, says industry veteran T.V. Mohandas Pai. The present business model of Indian IT companies—offshore-onsite work ratio of 70:30 would now go up to 90:10, the former chief financial officer of Infosys said. “So, what will happen is they (Indian IT firms) will offshore more work and increase their competitiveness. They will do only 10% work onsite, and 90% offshore,” Pai told <i>PTI</i>. “It can be done very easily for 70-80% of the business. It will improve their competitiveness and make them better,” he said. “The new H1B regulations are very good for Indian IT, and bad for companies which try to use it for cheap labour. First of all, Indian IT is not cheap because what they bill to clients is $125,000 to $150,000 per year (for an onsite employee),” he said. “The average pay is around $80,000-85,000 per year. They are unnecessarily getting a bad name, because some fly-by-night operators are trying to do body-shopping and spoil the name of the entire (Indian IT) industry,” he said. The new regulations would play to the strength Indian IT companies because they have been reducing the number of H1B visas they collected since 2014, he said. “So, they are already getting prepared. It will increase the billing because it will create artificial scarcity in America, and allow Indian companies to bill more for work because there are not enough Americans to fill the positions that are needed,” said Pai, who is chairman of Manipal Global Education Services and Aarin Capital. “It’s a blessing in disguise, I don’t think they need to be scared or anything,” he said. As for possible downsides on the visa front, Pai said there would be some uncertainties for the next six months “because nobody knows what they (US Labour department) are going to do and how they are going to behave and all that.” “Uncertainty is because the US Labour Department is threatening more inspections. They will find out the number of applications (by Indian IT firms for H1B visas) have come down and they should be happy,” Pai said. On what Indian IT companies should now do following the tightening of H1B visa regulations, he said, “Increase offshoring, increase automation and drive up billing rates.

1.0,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""S3l"">New Delhi: Sunil Munjal, who separated from his brothers in 2016 to carve an independent identity, has formed a new group company called Hero Enterprise that has started selling life and health insurance policies and plans to venture into aerospace parts. Hero Enterprise will, however, continue to focus on its existing real estate and steel businesses even as the group holding company consolidates its businesses and exit smaller ones such as Hero BPO.Sunil Munjal already sold motor insurance for Hero MotoCorp Ltd while he was still a part of the Pawan Munjal-led Hero Group. In an interview on Thursday, Sunil Munjal said that his insurance distribution firm, Ensure Plus, is also into non-motor insurance such as assets, buildings and aircraft. It has also started selling life insurance and health insurance policies. For life insurance, the company has a partnership with ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd, while for general insurance, it has tied up with National Insurance and Tata AIG. “We are the largest distributor of insurance in India... probably in the world. We wrote 10 million policies last year. Nobody does even half of it,” Munjal said.“Distribution is where the margin is. For us, to step back and put up an insurance company is nothing... It takes around Rs100 crore to get a licence. We have looked at that a few times but distribution is where the main margin is and relationships are. That’s where market connect is and we are very good at it,” he said. Hero FinCorp Ltd, a two-wheeler financing company run by Sunil Munjal’s nephew Abhimanyu, also plans to get into insurance distribution and that means a larger chunk of Sunil Munjal’s motor insurance business that used to come from Hero MotoCorp will get affected.“They will compete like any other entity. Within our group, we always had this system. We could buy and sell from our companies as well as outside. So, that ensures that everybody maintains quality and you are buying because of merit and not because it is your company,” he added.Sunil Munjal, 56, stepped down as joint managing director of Hero MotoCorp Ltd, India’s largest motorcycle maker, in July 2016. By exiting Hero MotoCorp, he raised around Rs3,500 crore.Sunil Munjal’s businesses were a small part of the $6 billion Hero group founded by Brijmohan Lall Munjal, the family patriarch who died in 2015 at the age of 92. He had five strategic businesses: insurance distribution, Hero Realty Ltd, Hero Management Service Pvt. Ltd, Ludhiana-based Hero Steels Ltd and Hero Mindmine Institute Pvt. Ltd.Munjal has hired P.N. Gupta, a former executive from Tata Group’s TAL Manufacturing Solutions, to enter the aerospace parts manufacturing. A person aware of Munjal’s plans in the defence sector said that he is scouting for manufacturing sites for composites.“Talks are still at an exploratory stage,” the person said on condition of anonymity.Munjal said that new business initiatives are not an area of “public conversation” and declined to comment specifically on his diversification.“I have never said yes or no. I would say it is a difficult area but high potential area because India is the largest known importer, in terms of reported numbers, of defence equipment in the world,” he said. “In today’s time, there is no reason for India to be (an import-dependent country). You have every capability and potential to build that capability (to manufacture) here in India,” he added.With 60% of India’s defence requirements met through imports, local defence production has emerged at the heart of the Narendra Modi government’s ‘Make In India’ programme. Under Hero Realty, Munjal has completed one project in Haridwar and a couple of others are under construction in Ludhiana and Mohali. “We have just closed a transaction in Gurgaon,” Munjal said.“We are targeting middle India—middle income, middle class, lower middle class, small town, mid-sized cities, tier III, tier IV cities, and we are trying to see if we can help improve people’s standard of living itself. So, the model is based in the price range between Rs20-Rs80 lakh and the bulk of it will be between Rs30-65 lakh,” he said.We are hoping to provide attributes, functionality of the apartments that one buys for Rs10-20 crore, he added.Munjal added that he is looking to exit smaller businesses such as Hero BPO.“We won’t keep any small business. We don’t want to be in any of the small businesses,” he added.In a separate development, Hero Enterprises’ chairman Sunil Kant Munjal has invested about Rs 100 crore in impact investment firm Aavishkaar Venture Management Services’ new fund ‘Aavishkaar Bharat Fund’, according to a statement on Thursday.Aavishkaar Venture Management is aiming to raise Rs 2,000 crore for a fund that will invest in businesses that are working with the underserved population in sectors such as agriculture, financial services, healthcare, waste and sanitation, renewable energy and logistics and supply chain.",2017-04-21,Sunil Munjal’s Hero Enterprise has tied up with ICICI Prudential Life for life insurance and National Insurance and Tata AIG for general insurance,company,02:49,"Sunil Munjal’s Hero Enterprise to focus on insurance, aerospace manufacturing"
-0.13,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"">Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd, despite a relatively good performance over the past two years, is battling perceptions of under-performance because of its inability to keep pace with its ambitious target of more than doubling its revenue to $20 billion by March 2021.This target appears to have done more harm than good: analysts continue to rate the company using it as a metric; and people in the know attribute the departure of at least a few senior executives over the past few years to it. Now, an analyst at a foreign brokerage has suggested that the company is better off without the target.ALSO READ: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Money/JbzPzyPMJdV4ZBhqSyxkbK/Has-Infosyss-recovery-dissipated-before-it-even-started.html"" target=""_blank"">Has Infosys’s recovery dissipated before it even started?</a>“Management continues to maintain ‘aspirational’ revenue and margin targets that are increasingly becoming unlikely to be achieved, in our opinion. Given Infy (Infosys) is now guiding to lower levels of both revenue growth and margins in FY18 (2017-18), we think management would be well-served to either amend or drop its aspirational targets,” Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 April. Based on its <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/hI2j9yckPHHX6PkEuKU2PK/Infosys-Q4-earnings-subdued-guidance-lower-for-201718.html"" target=""_blank"">guidance for 2017-18</a>, issued last week, Infosys expects to end the year with revenue of between $10.8 billion and $11.3 billion. Infosys maintains this target is an ambition and the management has no plans to dump it.In April 2015, Infosys first outlined its ambitious target: India’s second largest software firm wanted to become a $20 billion firm with 30% operating margin and to generate $80,000 in revenue from every employee working on a project.  In 2016, it tweaked the deadline to 2020-21. Infosys ended financial year 2015 with $8.7 billion in revenue, 25.9% in operating margin and generated $52,300 per employee.Two years later, Infosys managed a compound annual growth rate of 8.25% to increase its revenue to $10.21 billion but operating margin declined by 120 basis points to 24.7% and revenue per employee slipped to $51,400, making many question CEO Vishal Sikka’s strategy.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Not that Sikka hasn’t delivered. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17;  for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been  the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the “impossible targets.” “The industry is going through a structural change, and to make it worse, you set yourself impossible targets,” said a former EVP, who quit last year. “A large component of a senior executive’s salary is tied to company’s annual growth, which itself is linked to the long-term target.”Infosys says it outlined a target to make its employees work towards a goal and eventually help script a turnaround.“We gave this target because we believed this would help motivate employees, and help the CEO make them work towards a goal,” one board member, who was part of the goal-setting exercise, said on  condition of anonymity. “Looking back, I’m still not sure if it was a wrong step. I’m still on the fence,  thinking how and what we could have done better to make sure hopes did not run high and employees did not come under pressure.”One of the things Infosys could have avoided was linking Sikka’s salary to the target, said the second executive who quit, a former SVP. This seemed to suggest that  this was much more than an aspirational target, as the CEO himself has repeatedly said. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/nZzaphFLFUOqP1EuegR9EL/Infosys-CEO-Vishal-Sikka-takes-home-only-61-of-eligible-pay.html"" target=""_blank"">A weak performance in this year hurt Sikka</a>, who earned $6.8 million in 2016-17, less than the $7.3 million he earned in 2015-16.

-0.35,"Bengaluru: It’s hard to overstate the importance of the technology industry to India. Over the past three decades, the IT sector has helped drive the country’s economic growth, employed millions and made billionaires out of at least seven founders.Now the industry is at risk from US President Donald Trump’s policies. The administration is promising a clampdown on the work visas India’s tech services companies use to service American customers. In the days since the US government took first steps toward H1B visa reform, all of India’s high-profile technology tycoons have seen their net worth eroded.Azim Premji, chairman of Wipro Ltd and India’s fifth-richest man, and Shiv Nadar, the sixth-richest person in the country and chairman of HCL Technologies, have seen their shares slide. Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani and three other founders of Infosys Ltd, all among the top 100 of India’s richest billionaires, have taken a hit too.

The Bengaluru-based company is most vulnerable to US visa reforms because it has the lowest percentage of local hires in the US, Goldman Sachs analysts Sumeet Jain and Saurabh Thadani said in a research note last week. HCL and Wipro also have risks from visa reforms but they hire relatively more Americans, the analysts wrote.Infosys kicks off earnings season for the industry this week, giving investors a chance to get more insight into the challenges and corporate strategies for addressing them. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, the market leader, is scheduled to report results next week.The debate has been over the H1B visa program, which allows companies to bring 85,000 workers into the US from overseas each year. On 31 March, just as companies prepared to file applications for next year’s allotment, the Trump administration rolled out a series of policy measures making it harder for firms to use the program for computer programmers and announced measures to fight what it called “fraud and abuse.” In parallel, the Justice Department warned employers applying for visas not to discriminate against US workers. All of this was in line with promises made during Donald Trump’s presidential campaign to overhaul the program he described as bringing cheap overseas labour at the cost of American jobs and salaries.From India, those promises look like threats to the economy. Information technology is the largest employer in the private sector, providing a livelihood to nearly 4 million, and contributes about 9% of gross domestic product. India’s software and services exports total about $110 billion, with nearly two thirds of that revenue coming from the US.Visa uncertainty could wreak havoc with planning and jeopardize profits in the industry. It may also raise risks for customers that depend on such services, from Wall Street banks to retailers and airlines. “Difficulties in getting visas or rising salaries of H-1B employees will have a material impact on companies,” said Rostow Ravanan, chief executive officer of Mindtree Ltd, a Bangalore-based outsourcer that uses hundreds of H-1B visas every year.Several countries around the world are adopting or considering similar policies. That poses a threat to the business model perfected by Indian companies, Ravanan said. “These trends are dangerous because the IT industry and its talent serve the entire world,” he said.Leading outsourcers including Infosys, Tata Consultancy, Wipro and HCL Technologies declined to comment on the visa issue.Companies have been working on contingency plans. If foreign workers cannot go to the US, it will become more expensive to hire local staff. Companies may also try to do more work for American clients from abroad, including India.Nitin Rakesh, chief executive officer of tech services provider Mphasis Ltd is optimistic. He said the industry has gone through four or five reincarnations since the outsourcing business began. A Trump crackdown may lead to more innovation in the model.“Through leveraging all the possible technology, including mobility and cloud, the growth opportunities are immense,” said Rakesh, warning however that some companies will adapt and others may not. “Growth will not be homogeneous.” Bloomberg",2017-04-12,"US President Donald Trump’s H1B visa reform policies have eroded the net worth of India’s high-profile technology tycoons, including Azim Premji ",both,14:28,"H1B visa reform hits tech billionaires, from Azim Premji to Shiv Nadar"

As of 31 March 2017, the firm has closed the fund at $350 million,” Nitin Jain, chief executive-global asset and wealth management, Edelweiss, said in an interview.The fund achieved a first close of $205 million in June 2015.ESOF II, which invests in privately negotiated collateralized credit transactions, has raised funds from several institutional investors including public pensions and insurance companies. ESOF I had raised $230 million.Edelweiss’s second credit fund comes at a time when a host of other firms in the alternative investment space are in the market to raise credit-focused funds. These include the likes of Reliance AIF Asset Management Co. Ltd, Avendus Capital and private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. Lp and Baring Private Equity Asia.Credit products in the alternative investment space are seeing a sharp increase as investors hunt for higher yields in a lower interest rate environment, said Jain.“Increasingly, you are seeing that fixed income yields are becoming low. So, then, there is a hunt for yield. People want a higher yield, but a fixed income nature product. So a lot of interesting, absolute return products are getting traction in the market, which are alternate in nature—they can be credit funds or they can be hedge funds,” said Jain.People want double-digit returns and low volatility, so a lot of products are being created to deliver yields between 10-14% using credit, he added.The hunt for higher yields has also made other products such as public sector bank perpetual bonds or AT1 bonds (additional tier 1 bonds) attractive to investors, said Jain.“Perpetuals have become attractive and the need for higher yield is again driving that trend. Public sector banks are giving you a yield of anywhere between 9% and 10.5%. When you go to fixed deposits, you’re getting only 7-7.5%. While they have a slightly different risk profile, people are getting very comfortable with them,” said Jain.Led by Jain, the Edelweiss asset and wealth management business today manages assets worth Rs1.2 trillion, with over Rs60,000 crore worth of assets on the domestic wealth management side and the rest coming from the institutional asset management business.Edelweiss’s wealth management business caters to individuals across three categories—mass affluent, high net-worth individuals (HNI), and ultra HNI and family offices. The asset management business includes funds which invest in credit strategies across asset classes such as real estate, performing credit and distressed credit (including the Edelweiss asset reconstruction business) as well as public market funds. The firm’s wealth management business, which was set up in 2010, has witnessed a growth of almost 70-80% in the last two years, said Jain.Edelweiss is targeting a corpus of Rs1 trillion for its wealth management business, which it hopes to achieve in the next two years, he said. “For growing the wealth management business, we are tapping new generation entrepreneurs, family offices and employees in progressive organizations in sectors such as IT services and financial services,” said Jain.In order to achieve its planned growth, Edelweiss is also investing heavily in technology.“Technology is playing a very important role now. Clients want to access information, flow of information, practically on a real-time basis. Earlier it was acceptable if you told people the health of their portfolio once a quarter. Now, there are clients who want to track it on a minute by minute basis,” he said.The firm has embarked on a five-year digital transformation drive and has partnered with IT consulting and services firm IBM to help drive the transformation, said Jain.Edelweiss’s digital transformation drive is focused on increasing the productivity of its advisory team, while helping control costs to improve both the revenue and profit of the business.

0.21,"Bengaluru:Rajiv Bansal, former CFO of Infosys, has dragged his former employer to arbitration to claim the remaining Rs12 crore of his severance pay. Infosys had agreed to pay Bansal a severance amount of Rs17.38 crore or 24 months of salary, but the company suspended payments after he got Rs5 crore as co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthy and others objected to the severance package as excessive. According to sources, Bansal has invoked his rights to an arbitral tribunal and a meeting is scheduled next month. This has opened another battle front for Infosys, which is already fighting visa clampdown by US President Donald Trump and global headwinds. When contacted, Bansal declined to comment. “The company has already clarified on the severance package for the former CFO Rajiv Bansal through a detailed statement. We do not have anything additional to add at this point,” Infosys said in an e-mailed response. Bansal’s severance payout has been one of the issues that Infosys founders had raised to allege governance lapses at the Bengaluru-based firm. When Bansal left Infosys in 2015, Infosys had agreed to pay him Rs17.38 crore in severance pay, equalling 24 months of pay. In February, Infosys chairman R. Seshasayee had clarified that of the agreed amount, only Rs5 crore have been paid so far and that the remaining was withheld pending clarifications on the terms of the severance contract. He had also admitted that the “judgement” could have differed if circumstances were different or if certain processes had been in place.

-0.57,"Big plans are afoot for India’s sprawling hydrocarbons industry. Finance minister Arun Jaitley says the government aims to create an “integrated public sector oil major” to match the might of the international oil and gas giants. The big question is how that plan will unfold. Details are beginning to emerge.What’s the logic?The government owns majority stakes in eight major listed oil and gas firms. Combining some or all would create a bigger corporation with clout to negotiate better deals, for instance, on crude oil purchases. India imports some 80% of its crude needs. A merged business would also be less vulnerable to the vagaries of oil prices, say, by combining producers (which benefit from higher prices) with refiners (which get a boost from lower prices).Just how big are those eight state-owned companies?Their combined market value is almost $109 billion. If folded into one company, that would rank seventh globally among oil and gas majors. (Exxon Mobil is No. 1 at $345 billion). Such an entity would outstrip India’s private oil giant, Reliance Industries, whose market value is $71 billion. Six smaller unlisted joint-venture oil and gas companies may also come into play.What do we know about the government’s plan?Not much, in terms of detail. In August, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said his ministry was open to discussing a merger to create a larger, stronger national oil company and that the government was figuring out the appropriate model for the combination. Jaitley then spoke in mostly general terms during his 2 February budget speech, about strengthening public-sector enterprises through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions.Where are we now?According to the <i>Economic Times</i>, the oil ministry, which administers the industry and works independently of the finance ministry, held a meeting in March with the state-run oil companies and asked them to produce a road map for integration. So far, that road map appears to entail Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corp. purchasing the government’s stake in either Hindustan Petroleum Corp., worth $4 billion, or Bharat Petroleum Corp., worth $7.7 billion.How would that work?Surprisingly simply. ONGC could just buy shares from the government and keep the refiner as a separate subsidiary, obviating the need for an official merger. ONGC already has a refining subsidiary -- adding HPCL or BPCL would create the nation’s third-largest refiner. India would receive vital funds for reducing the country’s fiscal deficit, but the move would imperil Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s goal of cutting crude imports, since ONGC might need to divert spending from its exploration investments aimed at boosting oil and gas output.Is there a precedent?The government attempted something similar at least once in the oil sector, during the mid-2000s. Those efforts unraveled through opposition from some of the companies and employees. The newly proposed mergers deals would also need to surmount the enormous challenge of absorbing refiners with networks across 29 states, thousands of employees and unique work cultures.What about beyond the energy world?Air India has remained unprofitable since its 2007 merger with Indian Airlines, though it managed to reduce losses this year. The government has struggled to integrate the carriers, failed to achieve the expected synergies and faced labour issues. What does the market think?Shares of all but one of the five largest state oil companies fell in the two months after the February budget, even as India’s benchmark stock index surged.A 2015 study by the Journal of Business Management and Economics concluded that while mergers in India’s energy sector may not create immediate shareholder value, they produce companies that are better placed to compete and adapt.

This will be extended to other parts of the country after an assessment of consumer response.Diesel and petrol prices move in tandem with the price of crude oil in most countries. In January, <i>Mint </i>reported that the fuel retailers plan to introduce <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/29EfLi3mskCmsZYxzHLxIO/OMCs-plan-to-introduce-dynamic-pricing-at-all-retail-outlets.html"" target=""_blank"">dynamic pricing</a> in India this year.“We have been piloting dynamic pricing at a few of our retail outlets for some months now, and the response has been encouraging. This has allowed us to go ahead and introduce it formally,” an executive director from an oil marketing company said on condition of anonymity as he is not allowed to talk to reporters.Currently, state-run fuel retailers—Indian Oil Corp. Ltd  (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL)—revise petrol and diesel prices on the 1st and 15th of every month based on average international price of the fuel in the preceding fortnight and the currency exchange rate.“Due to the fortnightly revision of fuel prices, petroleum dealers were applying breaks (not lifting fuel daily) on uplifting of fuel. If the prices go up on the 1st or 15th of every month, there would be a rush to uplift products, else, the upliftment would be impacted. This would result in losses for OMCs and we wanted that this price predictability should go away. So  dynamic pricing will be a good bet,” said a senior official from an oil marketing company on the condition of anonymity.Shares of Indian Oil fell 0.07% to Rs408.90 on BSE, Bharat Petroleum rose 1% to Rs717.60, Hindustan Petroleum rose 1% to Rs542.45 while India’s benchmark Sensex fell 0.49% to 29,643.48 points.Although state-run fuel retailers have the capability to revise petrol and diesel prices on a daily basis, what needs to be monitored is how consumers react to  price volatility, industry experts say.“If there is heightened volatility in global markets due to geopolitical developments, it could get reflected in domestic retail prices too. Therefore, companies are doing the right thing in testing the model in pilot projects to see how its impact and consumer response. In the medium- to long-term, daily price revision may be a good idea as is practised elsewhere,” said R.S. Butola, a former chairman of Indian Oil.Indian Oil chairman B. Ashok and Hindustan Petroleum chairman and managing director M.K Surana didn’t immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment.Besides, global fuel prices and currency exchange rate, central and state taxes account for a major part of the fuel prices. It accounts for half of retail petrol price and 46% of retail diesel price. The central government collected Rs64,509 crore from petrol as excise duty in 2016-17 up to end-February, 20% more than what was collected in  the whole of FY16.

-0.67,"Anil Agarwal has sealed the merger of his mining and energy businesses in India, creating a BHP Billiton Ltd-like resources conglomerate, even as a recent investment in Anglo American Plc. raises questions about how far the billionaire’s ambitions stretch.Vedanta Ltd combined with unit Cairn India Ltd on Tuesday and fixed 27 April as the record date for determining the list of the latter’s shareholders who will be allotted stock in the parent company, according to a joint statement. Vedanta will offer minority shareholders of oil producer Cairn India one equity share and four redeemable-preference shares with a face value of Rs10 each as part of the deal agreement.The merger gives shareholders a company with a diverse portfolio encompassing iron ore, bauxite, aluminium, power, oil and gas that has the ability to ride out commodity cycles. Agarwal, a self-made billionaire, recently surprised the mining industry by becoming the second-biggest shareholder in Anglo American through an unusual deal that led analysts to speculate he might be planning to force a break up of or a merger with the century-old miner.“This merger will increase the appeal of Vedanta Ltd to global investors as it simplifies the structure and increases the size and free float of the company,” Tom Albanese, chief executive officer of Vedanta, said in the statement. The firm will continue to focus on remaining a low-cost and low-debt operator, he said.Agarwal’s fortune has been built on a series of ambitious acquisitions: In 2001, he bought control of then government-owned Bharat Aluminium Co. in one of the first tests of India’s efforts to offload state holdings. He followed with another government entity, Hindustan Zinc Ltd, in a deal that drew the attention of the nation’s top investigating agency. He successfully bid for what was India’s largest iron ore producer Sesa Goa Ltd. in 2007 and for Cairn India in 2010, despite having no oil and gas experience. Last year, Anglo American was said to have rebuffed informal approaches from the billionaire to discuss ideas including a combination with Hindustan Zinc Ltd.The Vedanta-Cairn combine was proposed by Agarwal in 2015, but delayed after Cairn shareholders held out for a better deal, which was offered last year.It will allow India’s most-indebted metals company after Tata Steel Ltd. to access Cairn’s cash pile, which stood at Rs26,000 crore ($4 billion) at the end of December. Vedanta’s debt at the time was Rs65,000 crore, while Cairn is debt-free.“They are under pressure because of the heavy debt and the merger is planned only because of this,” said Kishor Ostwal, managing director of CNI Research Ltd, an equity research provider in Mumbai. The strong commodity cycle has benefited the group and improving raw material prices will give them a further advantage, he added.Vedanta shares have nearly tripled in the past year, leading gains among India’s 100 largest companies. It advanced in March after unit Hindustan Zinc announced a special dividend of about $2.2 billion, of which the parent will get about $1.4 billion. The dividend payout will cover 68% of Vedanta’s debt maturities in the fiscal year ending March 2018 and alleviate near-term refinancing risk, according to Moody’s Investors Service.“The stock looks very interesting and our bias is positive,” Ashish Chaturmohta, head of derivatives and technicals at Sanctum Wealth Management Ltd, said by phone. “The dividend mostly is going to go for debt reduction and so will the cash with Cairn,” he added, saying the stock can move up further.Shares of Vedanta climbed 2.6% to Rs259.25 in Mumbai on Wednesday. The merged company will have a market-capitalization of about $15.6 billion and a higher free float of shares of 49.9%, according to Tuesday’s statement.Vedanta’s 6% 2019 dollar notes rallied 42% in the past year as the company reduced its leverage and strengthened prospects for repayments with dividends.

But Bhattacharya, 61, said she was hoping for good growth from the July-September quarter.“I’ve already had a number of meetings with people saying their capacity utilisation has gone up. Commodity prices have gone up, so to that extent people are coming with working capital requests,” she said.SBI has forecast loans to grow 11% this financial year after an expected 6.5% growth in the year ended March.Bhattacharya also said the central bank would need to offer rates matching or higher than the reverse repo rate of 6.00%, the rate lenders get for deposits at the RBI, should it implement a special facility to drain cash from the banking system.India’s central bank wants to withdraw some of the big cash pile accumulated in the banking system since the government banned circulation of big currency-notes, but lenders are keen to get proper returns in exchange for transferring cash.

Legislation to fix this issue is before the Senate and Turnbull is understood to have assured the company it will be resolved, <i>Sky News</i> reported on Tuesday.<a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Politics/z7t0pSQNM7DsPSELPMp6ZJ/Australia-ready-to-supply-uranium-to-India-as-soon-as-possi.html"" target=""_blank"">Australia ready to supply uranium to India as soon as possible: Malcolm Turnbull</a>Turnbull is said to have told Adani that he expected the changes overruling the court’s decision to be passed by the country’s Parliament when it reconvenes in May. He also told Adani that  the ruling had caused problems with many land deals across Australia, the report added. A quick resolution is crucial for Adani, which has invested $3.3 billion in the coal mine, railway and port project and said previously that it will start construction in the second half of 2017. An Adani spokesperson said that the meeting was “very positive” for the group’s Australian project, but refused to comment on details. “Happy to meet with Australian PM today. Working together for economic and stronger Australia- India ties,” Gautam Adani posted on microblogging site Twitter on Monday evening.Turnbull’s reaffirmation of his government’s commitment to Adani’s coal mine project comes after Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk met Adani last month at Mundra in Gujarat where the conglomerate runs a port.  In October, the Palaszczuk government exempted the project from new water laws that could have mired it in further legal challenges. The project, announced in 2010,  has run into resistance from environmentalists, resulting in delays of at least three years. Last year, the Queensland state’s department of environment and heritage protection (EHP) issued a final environmental authority (EA) for the project in the Galilee Basin. On 19 August, Adani won a major legal battle when the Australian apex court dismissed appeals lodged by indigenous community member Adrian Burragubba as well as a Brisbane-based environmental group against the project.ALSO READ: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Money/594tInYlgffnPFghva0reO/What-next-for-Adani-Power-Tata-Power-after-Supreme-Court-or.html"" target=""_blank"">What next for Adani Power, Tata Power after Supreme Court order on tariffs?</a>But that has not stopped protests.

The shares fell as much as 5.4%.Pretax profit for 2016 was $409 million, compared with a loss of $1.52 billion a year earlier, the London-based company said in a statement Friday. Operating profit excluding one-time items was $1.09 billion, missing the $1.42 billion average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by <i>Bloomberg</i>.Chief executive officer Bill Winters, more than a year and a half into the job, has yet to convince investors he can sustainably reverse the bank’s losses and restore a dividend, after a sharp drop in revenue and surging loan impairments in 2015 drove the Asia-focused lender to its first annual loss since 1989. Winters has also vowed to clean up the culture of the firm, where senior staff flouted ethics rules and considered themselves “above the law.”“We have sharpened our focus on all aspects of conduct,” Winters said in the statement. “The pace and scale of those changes—many of which were done in parallel and required intense periods of adjustment for employees—undoubtedly impacted some elements of the group’s financial performance in the period.

Loan impairments fell to $2.38 billion from $4.01 billion in 2015. In August, the bank said it would probably miss a profitability target set only last year, blaming an uncertain regulatory and economic environment.While bad-debt costs almost halved, the size of the “grade 12” category that houses the loans most at risk of default increased 26% to $1.5 billion last year. A “small number of exposures in the diamond and jewellery sector” drove loan impairments up to $511 million in Europe and the Americas.

-0.35,"Bengaluru: It’s hard to overstate the importance of the technology industry to India. Over the past three decades, the IT sector has helped drive the country’s economic growth, employed millions and made billionaires out of at least seven founders.Now the industry is at risk from US President Donald Trump’s policies. The administration is promising a clampdown on the work visas India’s tech services companies use to service American customers. In the days since the US government took first steps toward H1B visa reform, all of India’s high-profile technology tycoons have seen their net worth eroded.Azim Premji, chairman of Wipro Ltd and India’s fifth-richest man, and Shiv Nadar, the sixth-richest person in the country and chairman of HCL Technologies, have seen their shares slide.

The Bengaluru-based company is most vulnerable to US visa reforms because it has the lowest percentage of local hires in the US, Goldman Sachs analysts Sumeet Jain and Saurabh Thadani said in a research note last week. HCL and Wipro also have risks from visa reforms but they hire relatively more Americans, the analysts wrote.Infosys kicks off earnings season for the industry this week, giving investors a chance to get more insight into the challenges and corporate strategies for addressing them. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, the market leader, is scheduled to report results next week.The debate has been over the H1B visa program, which allows companies to bring 85,000 workers into the US from overseas each year. On 31 March, just as companies prepared to file applications for next year’s allotment, the Trump administration rolled out a series of policy measures making it harder for firms to use the program for computer programmers and announced measures to fight what it called “fraud and abuse.” In parallel, the Justice Department warned employers applying for visas not to discriminate against US workers. All of this was in line with promises made during Donald Trump’s presidential campaign to overhaul the program he described as bringing cheap overseas labour at the cost of American jobs and salaries.From India, those promises look like threats to the economy. Information technology is the largest employer in the private sector, providing a livelihood to nearly 4 million, and contributes about 9% of gross domestic product. India’s software and services exports total about $110 billion, with nearly two thirds of that revenue coming from the US.Visa uncertainty could wreak havoc with planning and jeopardize profits in the industry. It may also raise risks for customers that depend on such services, from Wall Street banks to retailers and airlines. “Difficulties in getting visas or rising salaries of H-1B employees will have a material impact on companies,” said Rostow Ravanan, chief executive officer of Mindtree Ltd, a Bangalore-based outsourcer that uses hundreds of H-1B visas every year.Several countries around the world are adopting or considering similar policies. That poses a threat to the business model perfected by Indian companies, Ravanan said. “These trends are dangerous because the IT industry and its talent serve the entire world,” he said.Leading outsourcers including Infosys, Tata Consultancy, Wipro and HCL Technologies declined to comment on the visa issue.Companies have been working on contingency plans. If foreign workers cannot go to the US, it will become more expensive to hire local staff. Companies may also try to do more work for American clients from abroad, including India.Nitin Rakesh, chief executive officer of tech services provider Mphasis Ltd is optimistic. He said the industry has gone through four or five reincarnations since the outsourcing business began. A Trump crackdown may lead to more innovation in the model.“Through leveraging all the possible technology, including mobility and cloud, the growth opportunities are immense,” said Rakesh, warning however that some companies will adapt and others may not. “Growth will not be homogeneous.” Bloomberg",2017-04-12,"US President Donald Trump’s H1B visa reform policies have eroded the net worth of India’s high-profile technology tycoons, including Azim Premji ",both,14:28,"H1B visa reform hits tech billionaires, from Azim Premji to Shiv Nadar"

We are looking at a collaboration of intellectual skills and the development of two countries together that might bring about global understanding between people,” Tata said.Ratan Tata, Chairman emeritus of Tata Sons, described the CMU-TCS partnership a visionary collaboration of skills that will bring understanding between young people of India, the United States and other places in the world. “The wide-ranging multi-national partnership that is creating new research opportunities, new student aid, and a brand-new facility for educational research that we are celebrating today has deep roots. In fact, the historical parallels and connections between the Tata Group of companies and Carnegie Tech and Carnegie Mellon make this new chapter in our partnership even more meaningful,” Suresh said.“In the late 19th century - years before this university was founded - the Tata family patriarch, Jamshedji Tata, came to Pittsburgh—the steel capital of the world—to learn from expert steelmakers how to launch his own steel-making business in India,” he said. Jamshedji Tata famously had four goals in life: setting up an iron and steel company in India, opening a world-class learning institution, building a unique cartel, and constructing a hydroelectric plant, he added. “Years later, a company affiliated with one of Andrew Carnegie’s executives landed a contract to build the Tata plant in India, bringing to life the Jamshedji Tata goal that mirrored Andrew Carnegie’s life’s work: the great steel empire built here in Pittsburgh, and a great university, Carnegie Tech, now known as Carnegie Mellon as we celebrate it today,” he said. Suresh said the latest addition to the rapidly-expanding CMU landscape, this nearly 50 000 gross square-foot TCS Hall will house research and academic spaces where both institutions will collaborate on mutual interests in fields such as cognitive systems and autonomous vehicles and robotics. “TCS Hall will house a variety of activities in education and research, as well as the CMU Mechanical Engineering and Robotics Departments. And it’ll fit seamlessly into Carnegie Mellon’s pioneering work in leading the fourth industrial revolution,” said the CMU president.

Why else would <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Money/av8lQqNsbamjuqskrIFRyO/Hindustan-Zinc-announces-special-dividend-of-1375-per-equi.html"" target=""_blank"">it decide on a hefty dividend</a> that entails a huge tax outgo and enriches the government more than anyone else? Vedanta has a 64.9% stake in HZL, but its share in the magnanimous Rs13,985 crore payout by the latter will only be 53.9%. The government, on the other hand, has a 29.5% stake in HZL, but gets 41.5% share of the spoils. This is thanks to the dividend distribution tax of over 20% that firms have to bear while paying dividends. A number of companies such as Wipro Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd have used tender buybacks as a means to return cash to shareholders, given the large amount of tax savings. Vedanta, unfortunately, doesn’t have that luxury. Because of a Supreme Court order that has stayed the sale of the government’s residual stake in HZL, it may not be able to participate in a tender buyback offer. And if the company were to go ahead with a buyback without the government participating, that would result in a drop in the government’s shareholding, which may again flout the apex court’s directives. As such, dividends seem to be the only option left to take cash out of HZL. From Vedanta’s point of view, the ideal outcome would be to buy the government’s stake and then use its control over the company to directly pursue inorganic opportunities such as its interest in Anglo American Plc. Now, apart from gifting the government a disproportionate share of HZL’s cash, it also has to share the company’s cash with its minority shareholders, as well as those of Vedanta Ltd and Vedanta Plc (<i>see chart</i>).Analysts at Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd say Vedanta could use the funds to service some of its debt and to fund its stake purchase in Anglo American. “Depending on the extent of upstreaming at Vedanta Ltd and Vedanta Plc, the ultimate promoter entity (Volcan Investments Ltd) could receive $220-$500mn of dividend which could come in handy in pursuing its Anglo American ambitions,” wrote the analysts  in a note to clients. Upstreaming refers to dividend payments by Vedanta Ltd and Vedanta Plc from their respective dividend income. In other words, Volcan may eventually get only 20-23% of the total payout by HZL. From HZL’s point of view, while the outflow looks huge, it hardly poses much of a problem for it. As of 31 December, the company’s net cash and cash equivalents were Rs25,319 crore. Post the dividend payouts, its cash balance is expected to drop to Rs15,000 crore, point out analysts from Edelweiss Securities Ltd. But that shouldn’t worry investors.

EV is short for enterprise value, and Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.

-0.91,"Bengaluru: In a conversation with <i>Mint</i>, Ravi Venkatesan, 54, who in addition to being Infosys co-chairman is also chairman of Bank of Baroda, said that one of his immediate priorities would be to align all stakeholders around the transformational journey that Infosys is in the midst of. <p class=""question"">Why did you agree to take on this role as co-chairman?Because the board asked me to. But also because I love Infosys. Just like the <i>Idea of India </i>(Sunil Khilnani’s book), the idea of Infosys is a powerful one; Infosys remains a vital institution of our country. It’s important that it continues to flourish.<p class=""question"">Was this decision solely the board’s or was it made after some of the founders suggested it?This was a decision of the board. Why did the board decide to go for a co-chairman? Simple because when an aircraft is going through turbulent weather, it only helps to get a co-pilot. <p class=""question"">Questions have been raised by some of the founders against the board and even against the management. So how would you get both the founders and board aligned and make sure this is not a distraction for the management? For the record, I was close to the founders of Infosys before I joined the board. What they accomplished was incredible. I hope to remain close to them long after I cease to be on the board. Equally, I believe in the strategy that (CEO) Vishal Sikka has set out for transforming Infosys. I intend to do my very best to see that he succeeds in this mission. Everything else is a sideshow. I don’t see any contradiction here.<p class=""question"">How do you rate Vishal’s leadership in the three years that he has been CEO now?I think Infosys has done somethings incredibly well under Vishal’s leadership. We have a bold and differentiated strategy which customers are excited about; customer satisfaction is at an all-time high. Most employees are energized by the vision and strategy. Vishal and his team have built on the momentum they inherited and closed the gap with competition. Many seeds for the future have been sown and we see the green shoots in many areas—in AI, in automation, with initiatives like design thinking. That said, the transformation is a work in progress. Some things aren’t working as intended and course corrections are being applied. There are pockets of underperformance which represent opportunities. We need to rapidly scale up things that are working. There are capability gaps that need to be fixed. But overall, I am optimistic about our prospects.<p class=""question"">How will the co-chair arrangement work? How will you delineate roles to make sure there’s no overlap?Sesh (R. Seshasayee) and I have known each other for 20 years and worked on the Infy board for six years, so we are quite comfortable with each other. We have decided that there are some areas that he will continue to lead such as overall leadership of the board or investor outreach while in other areas like strategy or talent I will work more closely with Vishal and his team. We have decided that we will work as partners rather than compartments.<p class=""question"">What are your immediate priorities?My first priority is to help align all stakeholders around the transformation journey that we are on. The second is to work closely with Vishal in helping build a world class leadership team that can execute the transformation strategy.Your elevation has been seen positively and the general view is that relations between the board and the founders will improve now. What’s your take on that and how do you intend to repair relations with the founders?I have the greatest respect for the founders of Infosys and especially for Mr (N.R. Narayana) Murthy who has been a mentor and friend for a long time. I believe that everyone wants the same thing—which is to see Infosys flourish and prosper from the incredible opportunities that are being thrown up by technology shifts. The board and leadership team wants this. Investors want this. Employees want this. The founders want this. However, this is a journey through uncharted waters and so the key is to earn the trust of all stakeholders so we stay together through the ups and downs of this voyage. Trust really is the key. This requires intense, honest and ongoing dialogue. It also requires courage, willingness to experiment, assimilate feedback, learn and change.After a stellar year in 2015-16, the last 12 months have been slow by Infy’s lofty standards. What in your opinion needs to be fixed immediately in order to get back the company to industry-leading growth?This has been a tough year for everyone with growth slowing and severe commoditization. Infy’s performance must be seen not just in absolute terms but in the context of the industry. Vishal has already commented on our performance and what he and the team will do. I personally believe we have to more aggressively move investments and our brightest people from more commoditized areas towards our best growth prospects which are in areas such as digital, cyber security, AI, IOT and so on. Our job as a board is to support management in moving much more quickly on the many opportunities we have.Will you reduce your other board commitments now that you’re taking up this role? Will you remain chairman at BoB?The transformation of BoB is also a work in progress. (P.S.) Jayakumar and his team have worked really hard and we are seeing the green shoots of their labour.

-0.25,"Indian oil firms delivered a subdued performance in the December quarter. Take for instance Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL’s) results. Despite the fact that it crossed the Rs8,000-crore mark in stand-alone net profit for the first time, the performance would have been sweeter if income from sources other than its main business had not played a key role in boosting profit. Notably, while RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM) improved to $10.8 a barrel from $10.1 a barrel in the September quarter, the measure was lower than expected, considering that the benchmark Singapore refining margin had done much better sequentially.GRM is the realization from turning every barrel of crude oil into finished products and is an important measure of profitability for refining firms.RIL’s petrochemicals segment performed well but that couldn’t compensate for the disappointment from the refining business. However, investors have little to complain given that the stock has appreciated as much as 21% till 17 March since RIL announced it will start charging its customers in the telecom business. Further stock appreciation will be dependent on how the telecom venture fares in the days to come.State-run refining and marketing firms—Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and India Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL)—delivered a decent performance. Reported GRMs improved sequentially. Inventory gains helped. According to analysts from Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, core earnings, adjusted for inventory gains, came in at Rs12.7/12.1/7.6/ share for BPCL/HPCL/IOCL versus reported earnings per share of Rs15.7/15.7/8.4, respectively. “After adjusting for one-offs, core earnings of IOCL and BPCL came in-line with our estimates but HPCL missed the mark on this metric as marketing margins disappointed,” an Emkay report said last month. However, broadly, reported earnings of all three firms were in-line, according to Emkay. These stocks have done well in the past two years, helped by diesel price deregulation and improvements in earnings. A further upside can come if refining margins improve further.Meanwhile, stocks of upstream oil firms—Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd—have performed well in the past couple of months, thanks to firmer crude prices. However, if oil prices continue to remain range-bound, further appreciation in shares of ONGC and Oil India will be tough.

Growth in constant currency terms stood at 8.7% for tier-I IT companies in the December quarter, excluding Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., according to data collated by Nomura Research. Two quarters ago, growth stood at over 10%, and a year before that, growth was in the teens.Of course, that growth rates have been declining in the IT sector is well known and, as a result, IT stocks have underperformed the Nifty 50 index by around 18% in the past year.The moot question is if the December quarter results give signs of a possible turnaround. Investors will be disappointed there. Nomura’s analysts point out that growth in the key US region was the slowest in 12 quarters. Growth in some of the industry verticals that were doing well in previous quarters, such as retail, healthcare and telecom, slowed in the December quarter. And the performance of the largest industry vertical—banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI)—gave no hints of a turnaround. Besides, as US firms await the broad policy direction of the new government, there may be some delays in taking decisions.Of course, there are some silver linings. Companies, for instance, are sounding more optimistic, especially with regards to demand from BFSI. Besides, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities say the intensity with which some large corporations shifted work to captive units earlier has abated to an extent.But, from the looks of it, things are likely to go further south before any turnaround comes about. The recent appreciation in the rupee is likely to worsen matters for Indian IT companies. Profit margins have already been under pressure, owing to the increased investments in building digital capabilities and thanks to pricing pressure in the traditional application maintenance work. Besides, all of the noise against H1B visas in the US may result in new laws that increase costs of providing on-site services. Kotak’s analysts wrote in a note to clients, “In case the rupee were to sustain at current levels, we do highlight that many traditional levers of the industry are exhausted...

Narayana Murthy’s demands when hostilities between the promoters and the board, led by chairman R. Seshasayee and management were at their peak in early February. At the time, an Infosys spokesperson termed <i>Mint</i>’s query on this  “speculative”.  It isn’t clear whether Venkatesan, former chairman of Microsoft India and the chairman of Bank of Baroda who has been on the board of Infosys since 2011, is  the person Murthy wanted as co-chairman. Murthy didn’t respond to a query. Venkatesan responded with a text message saying: “Big challenges; bigger opportunities.”Analysts have also argued that the promoters could be seeking a share buyback. Two of Infosys’s former CFOs, T.V. Mohandas Pai and V. Balakrishnan have articulated this demand.Analysts see three possible reasons for the announcements made on Thursday.One, the board wants to buy peace so that the management can be insulated from what CEO Vishal Sikka calls as “distractions”, which were partially responsible for a poor 0.7% sequential growth during the January-March period.ALSO READ: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/9L8GtJDZVBAkp1agBz3BHK/Infosys-CEO-Vishal-Sikka-says-will-have-to-live-with-H1B-v.html"" target=""_blank"">Infosys will have to ‘live with’ H1B visa policy: Vishal Sikka</a>Two,  Venkatesan’s elevation suggests that the board is working towards a succession plan, which could  possibly even see Seshasayee stepping down in  coming months, well before his term ends in June 2018.

Returning Rs13,000 crore is too little,” Balakrishnan told PTI over the phone. “On go-forward basis, returning 70% of free cash flow is almost similar to what they (Infosys) have today—that is 50% of net profit,” Balakrishnan said.Infosys on Thursday said will payout up to Rs13,000 crore in FY18 either in dividends or via a buyback or a mix of both, after it reported an almost flat net profit in the March quarter and sales outlook that fell short of estimates.The Bengaluru-headquartered, NASDAQ-listed company said it would begin to pay 70% of annual free cash flow as dividend compared to a previous policy of sharing up to half its post-tax profit.“... I think the benchmark for IT services companies should be Accenture,” Balakrishnan added. “Accenture returned substantial part of existing cash, and also, if I am right, they returned around 90% of free cash flow to shareholders every year. So, progressively Infosys should move towards this. That is a good benchmark.”On the appointment of Ravi Venkatesan as co-chairman of Infosys, Balakrishnan said there is no substance in that because the company today has a chairman, chief executive, chief operating officer, co-COO, chief financial offer, and a deputy CFO.“And I think it’s too top heavy.

Besides, the US-based firm has grown by as much as 28% annually in the past two years. Of course, operating margin is low at high single-digit levels, but this is typical of US-based tech firms.

Ltd said in a note to clients, “We believe that the nature of work that HCI does in the US provides limited opportunity for offshorability. While some margin benefits might still be realized on the back of cost cutting and other efficiencies, the major benefit due to offshoring will not materialize.”The big idea behind the acquisition then appears to be the ability to cross-sell Tech Mahindra’s services to a new set of clients. The company has almost no exposure to the healthcare provider space, and the acquisition will give access to 30 new clients. Overall, the healthcare and life sciences vertical contributes less than 5% to its revenues. Jefferies’ analysts point out that the acquisition is on the same lines as two previous acquisitions in 2016—Target and Bio Agency—where a specific expertise was acquired with the cross-sell of existing services being the major incremental positive.Alongside the company’s penchant for mergers and acquisitions, the performance of its organic business has also picked up in the past two quarters. In turn, this has got investors excited. Since it announced Q2 results in end-October, Tech Mahindra’s shares have risen by around 20%, far higher than the 7% gain in the Nifty IT index.In the process, its valuations have risen to 15.6 times estimated fiscal year 2017 earnings, only slightly lower than Infosys Ltd’s 16.2 times valuation. While the better-than-expected growth in the past quarters suggests Tech Mahindra is firmly on the recovery path, not everyone is convinced. Analysts at Nomura Research said in a note to clients, “We see the telecom (~47% of revenues) segment to be stable but not in a material rebound scenario, with likely near-term headwinds from LCC (Lightbridge Communications Corp.) restructuring and non-recurrence of milestone payments (which aided growth in Q3)...

The number of Indians in the US searching for jobs in India has gone up more than 10-fold between December and March, according to an analysis by consulting firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Pvt. Ltd, shared exclusively with <i>Mint </i>.There were approximately 600 US-based Indians seeking jobs in India in December 2016. By the end of March 2017, the number had gone up to approximately 7,000, Deloitte analysis said.ALSO READ: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/4kTpwSMqU4dPUBKIWr4TAN/Donald-Trump-orders-review-of-H1B-visa-in-deterrent-to-Ind.html"" target=""_blank"">Donald Trump orders review of H-1B visa norms, in deterrent to Indian IT companies</a>This data comes amid a crackdown by the Trump administration on job visas for skilled workers, including software engineers from India. US Citizenship and Immigration Services said employers seeking H-1B work visas—a non-immigrant visa allowing American firms to employ foreign workers—for 2018 declined for the first time in five years.The surge in the number of applicants has been triggered by Trump’s vows to protect jobs for locals. A <i>Bloomberg </i>report on Tuesday said Trump will take aim at information technology outsourcing companies when he orders a review of H-1B visa programmes to favour more skilled and highly paid applicants. The report also cited companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. and Mphasis Corp. as examples of outsourcing firms that would likely have fewer visas approved once the changes are adopted. The H-1B work visa programme channels thousands of foreign workers to the US technology industry.“While US companies will find some tech talent in the US, the numbers might be less than what are required to meet their needs. Add to that, the wages they need to pay to US employees will be much higher than what they pay to H-1B visa holders,” said C.K. Guruprasad, a consultant with executive search firm Spencer Stuart.On Tuesday, Australia abolished the 457 visa programme used by over 95,000 temporary foreign workers, the majority of them Indians, to tackle unemployment.Experts see global in-house centres (GICs) as a viable option for companies to not only retain Indian talent but also address the anticipated shortage in the required volume of workers in the US.According to Parag Saigaonkar, Principal at consulting firm Deloitte in India, while the initial thrust of GICs was on moving job roles from a high-cost to low-cost centre to get a competitive edge, companies are now looking at non-linear values that GICs can add to the business—new things that Indian GICs can produce—and supporting the parent organization.“With the seemingly shifting dynamics towards options between outsourcing and local hiring, companies with GICs in India could move Indian talent from the US to India and also hire locals into the GICs and thus sidestep the restrictions of outsourcing to third party companies,” Guruprasad said.According to K.S.Viswanathan, vice-president for industry initiatives at lobby group Nasscom, while the purpose of GICs so far has revolved around cost and skills arbitration advantages and talent consideration, it is now expected to change.“We are seeing a lot of companies looking at building newer competencies around newer technologies like machine learning, AI, automation, UI/UX, product management, DevOps etc,” said Anand Subramaniam, engagement manager and delivery head (GIC Accelerator Platform), Zinnov, a consulting firm.On an average, GICs add 50,000 to 70,000 people in India every year and due to the volume requirements, this number is expected to go up, according to Nasscom. According to the lobby group, there are over 1,000 GICs in India. Of these, around 67% of them are of US origin. Around 65% of the total workforce of 750,000 employed by these GICs are for US origin companies.",2017-04-19,The number of Indians in the US searching for jobs in India has surged 10-fold since December as Donald Trump moved to tighten US visa policy,both,11:07,"As US visa troubles deepen, more Indians look to come back"

The company’s March quarter results announcement was no different. Revenue grew 1% sequentially in constant currency terms, lower than analysts’ estimates of around 1.6% growth. Worryingly, revenues in the mainstay North American region fell by 1.8%, and those of the key banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) vertical fell 0.4%.<p class=""A5l"">ALSO READ: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/0iFeclCfsM3zRSZ13jiH6J/TCS-Q4-profit-rises-42-at-Rs-6608-crore.html"" target=""_blank"">TCS misses both revenue and profit estimates in March quarter</a>Still, chief executive officer (CEO) Rajesh Gopinathan said, “We are quite happy with the way we have ended the year.” He added on a call with analysts that the outlook for the BFSI segment remains positive, and that thanks to large deal wins, it may be only a matter of time before the expected growth comes in. TCS has been saying for the past few months that things are looking up in the US and particularly in the BFSI segment. Over 40% of its revenues come from the BFSI segment, while the North American region accounted for 54% of revenues last year.But after the March quarter performance, investors are likely to question the company’s optimism. As the chart alongside shows, year-on-year growth rates have fallen significantly at TCS in the past year. Besides, operating profit margin, too, has fallen below its targeted range of 26-28%. The result of this double whammy was that earnings per share grew by just 8.3% last year.With the rupee having appreciated sharply compared to the average rate in fiscal year 2017 (FY17), margins are expected to be under further pressure in the new fiscal year. What’s more, thanks to the many changes in H-1B visa rules and policies, costs of providing on-site services to clients are also expected to rise. As such, earnings can be under pressure in FY18. Against this backdrop, TCS shares trade at around 16 times one-year forward earnings. And while CEO Gopinathan said that he expects FY18 to be incrementally positive, things could turn out to be particularly dire, depending on new visa rules. “We see near-term impact on decision-making due to immigration-related issues, even as companies are denying this. We expect 1QFY18 to start slowly and do not build growth acceleration in FY18,” analysts at Nomura Research wrote in a note to clients. Some of the possible impact of new visa norms is detailed here: bit.ly/2ngI48H.And unlike TCS’s upbeat post-results commentary, most other technology companies including Accenture Plc. have guided for slower growth in the new fiscal year. Besides, while Infosys Ltd tried to soothe investors’ nerves by outlining a detailed capital allocation policy, TCS said it will stay with its existing payout policy.In sum, there’s nothing much to like in TCS’s March quarter results announcement, except perhaps for the management’s hopeful commentary. But given the fair bit of divergence between the company’s outlook three months ago and its actual performance, investors would do well to tread cautiously.",2017-04-19,"After the March quarter performance, investors are likely to question the optimism being shown by new TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan",competitor,07:25,"TCS results: Upbeat commentary, downbeat performance in March quarter"
-0.72,"New Delhi: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) missed analysts’ estimates for both revenue and profit in the fourth fiscal quarter, even as India’s largest software services firm’s full-year sales rose 6.2% to $17.58 billion.The company reported revenue of $4.45 billion in the three months ended 31 March, a 1.5% increase from the preceding quarter and 5.8% from the year-ago period. Net profit totalled $992 million, a 0.8% decline on a sequential basis and an increase of 5.8% from the year-ago period.A <i>Bloomberg</i> survey of 30 analysts had estimated TCS to report quarterly revenue of $4.62 billion and net profit of $1.03 billion in the quarter.Also read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/GKOA2xer3PawhCAAQjlQCP/TCS-unperturbed-by-possible-changes-to-H1B-visa-regime-CEO.html"">TCS unperturbed by possible changes to H1B visa regime</a>“FY17 was a year of broad-based growth amid economic and political turbulence in our key markets,” said Rajesh Gopinathan, who took over as chief executive of TCS in February. “We believe we are better placed for the year-ahead,” said Gopinathan, who spent much time on the numbers, suggesting that the new CEO will take time to probably replicate the success managed by his predecessor N. Chandrasekaran, the current chairman of Tata Sons Ltd. At the heart of TCS’s underperformance is the company’s inability to generate more business from its largest customers, banks, in its largest market, the US. TCS’s  banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) segment, which accounts for over 40% of its revenue, grew 4.8% from a year earlier in constant currency terms. North America, which brings 54% of its business, reported a 4.3% rise.TCS does not give quarterly or annual forecasts but a few equity analysts are sceptical about the company’s prospects. The January-March quarter marks the 10th straight quarter (the company has recorded slow growth since July 2014) in which TCS has either underperformed, or at best managed to keep up with estimates. “Looking at this protracted slowdown, I believe TCS has reached a point where unless the company really brings about a change in the way it has done business, it will be tough for the company to ever beat street expectations,” said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage, on the condition of anonymity. “At best it can match street expectations.”TCS’s performance mirrors the poor show put up by Infosys Ltd last week, and this is worrying for three reasons.First, both growth and profitability for Indian IT firms is under pressure. Mumbai-based TCS reported a full-year increase of 8.3% in constant currency terms, similar to the full-year growth reported by Bengaluru-based Infosys (with $10.21 billion in revenue) although Infosys reported a higher 7.4% expansion in dollar revenue.Like Infosys, TCS’s growth in 2016-17 was slower than in 2015-16: TCS’s revenue growth in constant currency terms was 3.6 percentage points slower than the 11.9% increase in 2015-16. TCS added $1.03 billion in incremental revenue in the year ended 31 March 2017, less than $1.09 billion added in new business in 2015-16 when it reported a 7.1% increase and half of the $2.01 billion in new business added in 2014-15. TCS’s operating margin in the January-March quarter and for the full year stood at 25.7%. Operating margin narrowed 80 basis points from 26.5% in 2015-16, again similar to Infosys, which too saw its profitability eroded as commoditized outsourcing contracts see intense pricing pressure.Despite falling short of its operating margin forecast of 26-28% in the last financial year, the company’s management retained this guidance for the current fiscal year, which at least two analysts say will be “impossible to achieve”.“In this kind of environment, where most companies want more skilled people at client-facing sides, when most countries are adopting a protectionist stance, it looks impossible to keep operating in that band,” a Mumbai-based analyst at a foreign brokerage said, requesting anonymity.Second, despite higher growth in digital, which remains a fuzzy word, and the success of new and renew strategy rolled out by CEO Vishal Sikka to revive Infosys, both companies continue to be plagued by anaemic growth. This has made many analysts question if existing traditional contracts are merely getting rebadged as digital. A case in point: TCS claims its digital business grew 29% in the last year and now brings $3 billion in business.Finally, both TCS and Infosys continue to shy away from acquiring technology-focused firms. Infosys has not made a single acquisition in the last 18 months; TCS has looked away from acquiring a company since it partnered with Japan’s Mitsubishi Group in 2014. This is important because most large technology firms, including Accenture Plc, are looking at acquisitions to bring in new technology and skill sets. Nevertheless, the quarter does have some positives. For starters, the TCS management claimed that its insurance business under Diligenta and Japan has turned the corner, with Gopinathan expressing confidence of growth from these two lagging business units.On Tuesday, TCS shares fell 0.53% to Rs2,308.65 on BSE, while the benchmark Sensex declined 0.32% to 29,319.1 points. The results were announced after the end of trading in Mumbai.",2017-04-19,"Q4 revenue of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) rose 5.8% from the year-ago period to $4.45 billion, while Q4 profit increases 5.8% to $992 million",competitor,05:15,TCS misses both revenue and profit estimates in March quarter
-0.44,"Bengaluru: For Vishal Sikka, 2016-17 stands as a rebuke.After three consecutive downward growth revisions, Infosys’s dollar revenue growth in the year ended 31 March 2017 will be at best 7.6%, 150 basis points (bps) lower than the 9.1% growth in 2015-16, and 620 bps short of its first projected 13.8% growth outlined in April last year. One bps is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Departure of four executive vice-presidents (EVP) in financial year 2017 (in addition to four EVP exits between August 2014 and March 2016) implies that Sikka continues to struggle to build a stable top leadership team. Further, Infosys continues to look away from acquisitions (it’s been 18 months since the company made its last acquisition), which makes one wonder what Houdini trick the management has to achieve its target of becoming a $20 billion firm by March 2021.Also read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/SqNSGmPTIfX68gCBjJSgdL/Will-corporate-earnings-disappoint-once-again.html"" target=""_blank"">Will corporate earnings disappoint once again?</a>Finally, Infosys founder N.R.Narayana Murthy’s outburst, twice in public, against some of the decisions by the board is another painful blow to Sikka. Agreed, Murthy has not questioned Sikka directly. But few of these decisions, including agreeing to a generous severance money to its former CFO (chief financial officer), and giving a hike to the current COO (chief operating officer), were approved by the management, and so it is naive to conclude that all is okay between Sikka and Murthy.Understandably, these developments have unnerved shareholders: in full fiscal year 2017, Infosys shares declined 16.2%, more than the 9% fall by BSE IT index, even as the benchmark Sensex index returned 17% gains. For these reasons, business historians would take note of the fall in Sikka’s popularity: from being hailed as a hero in the first 18 months, Sikka now battles allegations of skulduggery and corporate greed.So what can Sikka—and Infosys—do to possibly break this impasse?First, get back growth and improve its execution. A related second measure is to get some growth from three divisions: Infosys BPO, EdgeVerve, the products and platforms unit (together bring about 13% of revenue), and Infosys Consulting. Infosys needs to improve its ability to sell more solutions from these three services to its clients. Lastly, Sikka needs to arrest senior management departures and build a stable leadership team. All this needs to be done swiftly, and once completed, hopefully, any corporate governance concerns of shareholders (including the founders) should be assuaged. It is important to note here that the displeasure expressed by some of the founders against the board only coincided with the period when Infosys’s growth started slipping (during the first quarter of last year).Significantly, Sikka’s $8 million performance-related pay as part of his $11 million compensation is a thorny issue, and how the board justifies this variable salary to its CEO on Thursday will dictate if there is a third instance of public spat between Murthy and the board. Is all this doable? Unlikely.Simply, because for IT services firms, chasing reclusive growth is more challenging than ever. Moreover, in case of Infosys, nothing short of a miracle can bring back peace between some of the founders and the board and management. With this as a backdrop, <i>Mint </i>puts the spotlight on five things to watch in Infosys’s fourth quarter earnings on Thursday:Revenue forecast: Brokerage firm BNP Paribas sees Infosys recording 1.3% sequential increase in revenue at $2.58 billion for the January-March period. The Infosys management will be mindful that this growth will be 30 basis points less than what the company did in January-March last year. Analysts term the growth in the fourth quarter as “exit rate” and a strong growth helps to start on a good note in the new financial year. Again, management commentary for the April-June period will be crucial.Will Infosys give full-year guidance? For Infosys, providing a growth outlook is one decision which appears to be going down the wire. Analysts believe the management will give a growth outlook. Based on conversations with executives familiar with the development, this paper thinks otherwise and Infosys may discontinue from this practice. The board will eventually take a call when it meets on 12 and 13 April but this decision will decide the road ahead for the Infosys stock. Performance of top customers: During the second and third quarters, Infosys’s largest client and top five and top 10 clients gave less business to the company. Until the June quarter of last year, Sikka did well to get more business from its largest clients. Since Infosys gets a fifth of total revenue from its top 10 clients, the management needs to reverse this decline if Infosys expects to record sustainable growth. A rain-check on Infosys’s new initiatives in the wake of President Trump’s strict visa laws: Over the last 33 months, Sikka has steered Infosys to embrace newer ways to do business, such as by bringing elements of user-centric method of Design Thinking. At the same time, Infosys has increased its focus on building platforms, in an effort to move away from people-led model of doing business. All these measures will be tested as US President Donald Trump works to have a strict policy in place which makes it arduous for outsourcing companies to bring engineers in the US. Hence, commentary on how Infosys is monetising its platforms business and impact of changes in visa will be eyed.Weak areas: Sikka has been unable to get respectable growth from EdgeVerve and Infosys BPO in his near three-year stint at Infosys. Another disappointment has been that the consulting division too ran into trouble in April last year. Infosys has put in a new leadership team at all three units over the last year, and management commentary on how soon it expects growth from these three units should decide the overall growth for the company.",2017-04-13,"Infosys founders spat, Donald Trump’s US visa policy and three consecutive downward growth revisions are likely to weigh in on the Q4 results to be declared today",competitor,05:04,Infosys results today: Five things to watch out for

In constant currency terms, Infosys now expects 6.5-8.5% growth for the full year.Infosys’s lower growth guidance of 6.1-8.1% in 2017-18 means the firm expects less incremental revenue this year.

The distractions he is referring to are the two public spats between Infosys co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthy and the board, where the former raised issues of corporate governance and disproportionately high salaries to the CEO and COO.Although Infosys will likely grow faster than both Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Wipro Ltd in 2016-17, its growth is lower than the 8.7% reported by Cognizant in 2016. TCS declares its earnings on 18 April and Wipro declares its fourth-quarter results on 25 April. Industry body Nasscom also avoided giving a growth outlook for India’s $150 billion outsourcing sector in February, on account of the uncertain macroeconomic outlook.“In order to get the stuttering sales engine firing again, Infosys needs to articulate its strategy in a more nuanced way and drive it through the organization,” said Thomas Reuner, managing director of IT outsourcing research at HfS Research. “Infosys urgently needs to focus on sales execution.”Investors punished the stock, which fell 3.71% to Rs932.90 on  BSE at the close on Thursday, dragging the benchmark Sensex down 0.61% to 29,461.45 points.Infosys’s poor performance also hurt Sikka, who earned $6.7 million in 2016-17, less than the $7.3 million he earned in 2015-16.

0.08,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"">Mumbai: The quarterly earnings season that begins this week will determine whether Indian stocks that have rallied to record highs last week will be able to sustain the gains. Inflows from foreign and domestic investors have been driving up stocks but they may easily retreat if earnings disappoint. With rising commodity prices and the lingering effects of demonetization, earnings prospects for most companies are anything but rosy, analysts say. Companies, excluding banks and commodities suppliers, are likely to be weighed down by margin pressure as raw material costs have surged from a year earlier, they said.Margins of members of the Nifty index are estimated to narrow by as much as 116 basis points in the three months ended 31 March because of rising input costs, Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a note released on 7 April. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Infosys Ltd, Bajaj Capital Ltd and Reliance Power Ltd are scheduled to report their fourth quarter earnings on 13 April. Analysts expect quarterly earnings growth to be driven by banks and metals companies. Banks’ profit growth in the March quarter is likely to be boosted mostly as a result of a favourable base effect. They had reported weak earnings in the year-ago period because of higher provisions following the Reserve Bank of India’s asset quality review. For metals companies, higher commodity prices are expected to support earnings growth.“Excluding banks and commodities, profits are likely to contract by 9%, similar to last quarter’s contraction and significantly lower than the 10% plus profit growth seen in FY15, FY16 and H1FY17. The slowdown in profit will be more pronounced in consumption sectors and cement,” Edelweiss said in the 7 April note. The brokerage expects FY17 Nifty earnings per share (EPS) to grow 10%, a marked improvement over the past two years, with Nifty EPS expected at Rs455, Rs555 and Rs660 at the end of FY17, FY18 and FY19, respectively. The brokerage expects Nifty firms to report revenue, operating profit and net profit growth of 15%, 8% and 14%, respectively, in the March quarter. Analysts are worried that the lingering effects of demonetization are still likely to impact companies that are dependent on domestic consumption. Recovery of volume growth is likely to be one of the key concerns in the March quarter earnings, Sanjay Mookim, India equity strategist, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA-ML), said on Thursday. BofA-ML expects earnings growth to improve from sub-5% in FY17 to 12% in FY18 and 15% in FY19. Indian markets have touched record highs in March and April after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party won the crucial Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. The Sensex and Nifty rose 11% and 12%, respectively in the March quarter and if earnings fail to deliver, the rally may lose steam.The net income of Sensex companies is likely to grow 9% on an annual basis and 15.3% quarter-on-quarter, Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report dated 7 April.Excluding banks, the brokerage expects an 8.8% year-on-year growth in net income. Weak demand environment, rising raw material costs and increase in discounts may result in an annual decline in net income for automobile firms, while downstream energy firms may be hurt because of lower refining margins, muted growth in volume and the recent decline in global crude oil prices. Kotak estimates Sensex FY18 EPS at Rs1,682 and FY19 EPS at Rs1,972. Its Nifty EPS estimates for FY18 and FY19 are Rs520 and Rs608, respectively. Gautam Duggad, head of research at Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd, said the March quarter may see margin contraction of 50 basis points for firms under the brokerage’s coverage, excluding financials. “We are expecting 23% earnings growth for our universe and 22% CAGR over FY17-19. Expectations for our Motilal Oswal universe net profit growth is 28% and largely led by three sectors—PSU banks, metals, oil and gas. Rest of the universe may decline by 5%,” he said. Rakesh Tarway, head of research at Reliance Securities, expects 10% profit growth in the March quarter, reflecting similar trends in the first nine months of the fiscal year. He, however, said commodity prices will have a marginal impact on profitability as firms in many industries like tyres, autos and packaged consumer goods have raised prices. “Also, commodity prices have now started stabilizing, which will further insulate margin erosion,” he added. According to Deutsche Bank, Sensex firms are expected to post a 9.1% profit growth in the fourth quarter. “Excluding banks, Sensex net profit growth is likely to be at 5.4%. Autos are likely to be the biggest drag on Sensex growth, as our analyst has factored in a one-time impact of the BS-III vehicle ban,” it said in a note dated 7 April. In the current fiscal year, CRISIL Ratings expects corporate revenue to grow at around 8% on a year-on-year basis. “Revival in sectors such as construction equipment, EPC (on improving order book); metals (especially non-ferrous) and sugar—on better prices, are expected to aid the improvement,” the rating agency said on 3 April.",2017-04-10,"With rising commodity prices and lingering effects of demonetisation, earnings prospects for most companies for the March quarter are anything but rosy",competitor,20:41,Will corporate earnings disappoint once again?

But since then, the Indian markets have rallied and are at record highs, and reforms are on track, including the passage of GST. Foreign direct investment (FDI) into India touched an eight-year high of $46.4 billion in 2016.Wait—India passed the GST and that astonished me. I am surprised that Mr Modi’s government got that through. It is a historic move as this has been a very contentious issue among Indian politicians for several years.You say FDI flows into India are at record highs, and it is certainly not me. I am surprised with the FDI inflows—while Modi has undertaken small reforms, and cleaned up some stuff, I am not aware of any big steps to boost FDI. Yes, I am impressed, and I see that the markets are at an all-time high; currency is going up—they are making new highs without me, and that does not make me happy.This has made me realize that something is happening in India. When GST was passed, I reconsidered investing in India, and I thought, “wait a minute—this is going to work”. I am positively impressed, but I’am not back to investing in India yet—the markets are at an all-time high, but I don’t want to jump on to a moving train. When you jump on to a moving train, you’ll get hurt.I missed the bus in India. If Modi continues doing stuff like GST, then not just me—everybody has to pay a lot more attention to India.

I am invested in Russia. One reason why Russia does not have a high level of debt is that no one was willing to lend them money—and that is not necessarily a good thing. Indian politicians have been saying for a while now that the country will address this situation of debt, but nothing has been done. Some studies say India’s debt-to-GDP ratio is at 90% now. It is difficult to grow at a rapid pace when you have such high levels of debt, because you are dragging along interest rate payments. But India is still on my list, especially if Mr Modi can continue doing some of the stuff that he said he would do, and especially if the government makes the currency convertible and opens up the markets. I am more impressed by Mr Modi as a politician than as someone who is executing reforms—yes, GST was extraordinary. But your prime minister is a great politician; he is travelling around the world and making friends everywhere. As a politician, Mr Modi is one of the most successful and exceptional of this generation—no question about that. No surprise that he has picked up all states in the recent elections. Seventy years since independence, he is cleaning up the gigantic mess with moves like GST, which no on else has been able to do so far.<p class=""question"" csl=""?channel=BP%20Print#16"">Finance minister Arun Jaitley recently said India’s economy is expected to grow at 7.2% in 2017 and 7.7% in 2018. What is your view?Most people don’t trust these numbers, including me. I used to say that what India does is to wait for China to announce its numbers, and then top them. I am skeptical of Chinese numbers and I am skeptical of Indian data. I am skeptical of American numbers, too. I’ve learnt over the years that if you are sitting and watching government numbers, and do your investments based on that, you are not going to make much money. Not too long ago, they caught the Germans faking numbers—the Germans of all people!<p class=""question"" csl=""?channel=BP%20Print#16"">When you look at India, what are the risks? Could it be populist steps leading to 2019, the reforms process not continuing, or rising oil prices?I am more worried about the world because that will impact India. Yes, India has elections coming, and normally when that happens, any politician will do anything to win elections. Mr Modi is in a position to do a lot of stuff. I am not too worried about what is happening internally in India as the Modi-led government has momentum and everything going for it. The world situation is more worrying. Mr Trump has now bombed Syria. Many American presidents love war, and Mr Trump had said he was a non-interventionist. Now look at him! He is involved with Syria, and also saying he is going to get involved with North Korea. These can potentially not be good for the world. If the Middle East blows up in the next year or two, it won’t help the markets. It will help Russia and oil. It won’t help India or China. Mr Trump has promised to have trade wars with Mexico and China. He has not done it so far and so, maybe, is just another lying politician. But he said the same of Syria and then he intervened. He has said North Korea better watch out. He met with the Chinese and did not get anything. Power corrupts. Interest rates are going higher no matter what happens. The French and German elections are coming up—they could be disruptive. These worry me more than what Mr Modi is doing inside India.See, first I was interested in India because of his (Modi’s) record and what he said he planned to do. Then I invested. But he did nothing much for two years, and I sold. Unfortunately, I sold too soon. Modi will not do anything foolish before next elections—but the global situation can have an impact on India, irrespective of what Modi does. On the (farm) loan waivers, while I would say it is terrible economics, it is also brilliant politics.<p class=""question"" csl=""?channel=BP%20Print#16"">Not just India, the global markets have rallied since Trump took over. So where can one invest in times like these?America is at an all-time high, and be it Japan or Germany—their markets are all doing well. There is a lot of money floating around. I had expected it all to slow down by now, but it has not. The Americans say they are going to be cutting back—but nobody has really done that in that past year or two. The only place I am looking to invest right now is Russian government bonds because the yields are very high—the rouble is down a lot. For whatever reason, Russia, which has been the most hated market in the world, is becoming less hated—more countries and politicians are reconsidering Russia. I’ve learnt in my life that if you buy things that are hated, they will make a lot of money even if takes a couple of years.India is at an all-time high.I own a lot of US dollars, and the reason I own it is because of the turmoil that I see coming, and people look for a safe haven in times like that and the dollar, rightly or wrongly, is considered a safe haven. But it is not—America is the largest debtor nation in the history of the world. What will happen is the US dollar will get overpriced and may even turn into a bubble, depending on where the turmoil is, and I hope that at that time, I am smart enough to sell the US dollar and put my monies elsewhere. Conceivably, it will be gold. Often, when the US dollar is very strong, gold goes down. I own gold, but I’ve not been buying gold in recent years. But if gold goes down sufficiently, I will sell my US dollars and buy gold. I expect the dollar to go substantially higher, and I hope I can sell then.Crude is in the process of making a bottom—it is a complicated bottom—we are going to look back in a few years from now and say that in 2015, 2016 and 2017, crude made its bottoming pattern. I will not sell crude now, especially if Trump is going to throw some more bombs around.<p class=""question"" csl=""?channel=BP%20Print#16"">The Fed has said they will raise rates again this year. What’s your view on that?The Fed will continue to raise interest rates—we cannot continue like this—negative interest rates in most parts of the world are destroying a lot of people. Many pension plans, insurance companies and trusts are suffering badly now—you are going to have some pension plans in America go bankrupt, or not earn any money. They have the obligations to meet their promises as people continue to get older. When interest rates go higher, they are going to make bonds go lower—it is going to help the US dollar. Historically, in the US, if the Fed raised interest rates four times, it meant the stock market would go down and go down substantially for a while—it is clear that the Fed will raise interest rates four times, and it does not mean that it has to happen that way. One could counter and say, rates going up from zero to four times is not such a big deal and, therefore, it is different this time. Four of the most dangerous words in the financial markets are: “it’s different this time”. It is very dangerous when you hear people say that.<p class=""question"" csl=""?channel=BP%20Print#16"">We are already four months into this calendar year. What do we need to look out for when it comes to the rest of 2017?We are also eight years into an economic recovery in the US, which is also very unusual. Most times in the US, every four years to 7-8 years, we’ve had economic setbacks since the beginning of the republic. Again, it does not always have to happen that way, but it nearly always has. Yes, we are four months into 2017, but I am more worried about the next couple of years. Mr Trump has promised some wonderful things. He has promised lower taxes, which is great for any economy and America is the largest in the world. He has promised to rebuild infrastructure, and that is wonderful, and we need it. He has promised to bring US dollars home—we have $3 trillion sitting outside the US by American companies and he has promised tax incentives to bring that home. He has promised to cut regulations and controls in the US economy—all of that is fantastic. If he does all this, and does not go to war, and also does not engage in a trade war, we can continue to have a good time for the foreseeable future. But I am skeptical because interest rates will be going higher, and because it has been eight years since we’ve had no problems in the US. For the US to continue this run, it can happen, but it has to be on a lot more debt. If all of that leads to a bubble…The other side will be very bad.

-0.43,"Charlottesville,US: To transform India’s economy, there is a need to reduce “friction” in businesses and create an “environment” wherein the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs, Infosys founder N. R. Narayana Murthy has said. For the transformation of the Indian economy, he said it is essential for the younger generation to be daring and that India is integrated with the global economy. “We still have a little bit of work in reducing friction to businesses. We need to create an environment where the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs than it is today,” Murthy, 70, told students of the prestigious Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia here. Murthy, the recipient of the 2017 Thomas Jefferson Foundation medal in Global Innovation, was responding to Darden School of Business Dean Scott Beardsley who asked, “what do you think needs to happen next to transform India’s economy. What is next”.

We have to become much more integrated to the world economy so that we can consider the entire world as our market and can become globally competitive. “And most importantly we can become much more open minded to learn from the wonderful things that are happening in this country and elsewhere. I would say these are required (for transforming India’s economy to the next level),” Murthy said. He, however, refrained from elaborating what the Indian government needs to do to create the environment of trust in its entrepreneurs and said, “I will tell you why, as an Indian citizen, it may not be proper if I were to be critical about India when I am outside India”. Interacting with students, he said, challenges for entrepreneurs are now different than the time when he started Infosys. Those days access to capital was almost non-existent and government was a big irritant. “Today, challenges are different. But in some sense even more complex, because today’s entrepreneurs have to be much more smarter than what we were because there is so much of competition on a global scale. Before you can say this can be done, somebody else may have already done it.” “Therefore, today’s entrepreneurs would have to be much more nimble, global, competitive because market is truly determinant for success today unlike our time when managing government was a big determinant in India,” he said. Murthy said good governance is all about maximising shareholders’ value while ensuring fairness, transparency and accountability to all stake holders. Of all the stakeholders, society is the most important player. “Respect from the society is the most important ingredient for longevity of a corporation,” he said. “To be honoured by the most innovative country in the world and to be awarded a medal in the name of Thomas Jefferson, author of Declaration of Independence is to me a big honour. I will certainly work hard, and hopefully smart in the remaining years of my life, to deserve this kindness, this generosity and this affection on their part,” he told <i>PTI</i>. The fact that the university has seen it fit to pick up somebody from India, and bestow this honour shows how open this country is and how generous they are, Murthy said. “Therefore this is a clear example of how Indian students wherever they are whether in India or here or anywhere else can be sure that as long as they are good citizens of this world, contribute to make the society a better place through peaceful and harmonious methods, they will be recognised, appreciated,” he said. Murthy said that Indian students are making a positive impact in the countries they are studying. “I have not come across a single person of Indian-origin who has conducted himself or herself in a manner that has brought sorrow to the society they are living in, anywhere, wherever in the world. So I think that is the right way. “I am very very proud of our Indian students. They are smart, have very good values and are very peaceful. They contribute to the society in a very significant way wherever they are. I just want them to continue to do this,” the Infosys founder said. The one important principle that Indian students should remember in everything they do is will this make India a more respected place, a more respected nation? Will this action of mine make me a better part of this community? Will this action deserve appreciation and affection from other members in this community? If they remember these then they will do everything possible, Murthy said.

-0.25,"Indian oil firms delivered a subdued performance in the December quarter. Take for instance Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL’s) results. Despite the fact that it crossed the Rs8,000-crore mark in stand-alone net profit for the first time, the performance would have been sweeter if income from sources other than its main business had not played a key role in boosting profit. Notably, while RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM) improved to $10.8 a barrel from $10.1 a barrel in the September quarter, the measure was lower than expected, considering that the benchmark Singapore refining margin had done much better sequentially.GRM is the realization from turning every barrel of crude oil into finished products and is an important measure of profitability for refining firms.RIL’s petrochemicals segment performed well but that couldn’t compensate for the disappointment from the refining business. However, investors have little to complain given that the stock has appreciated as much as 21% till 17 March since RIL announced it will start charging its customers in the telecom business. Further stock appreciation will be dependent on how the telecom venture fares in the days to come.State-run refining and marketing firms—Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and India Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL)—delivered a decent performance. Reported GRMs improved sequentially. Inventory gains helped. According to analysts from Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, core earnings, adjusted for inventory gains, came in at Rs12.7/12.1/7.6/ share for BPCL/HPCL/IOCL versus reported earnings per share of Rs15.7/15.7/8.4, respectively. “After adjusting for one-offs, core earnings of IOCL and BPCL came in-line with our estimates but HPCL missed the mark on this metric as marketing margins disappointed,” an Emkay report said last month. However, broadly, reported earnings of all three firms were in-line, according to Emkay. These stocks have done well in the past two years, helped by diesel price deregulation and improvements in earnings. A further upside can come if refining margins improve further.Meanwhile, stocks of upstream oil firms—Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd—have performed well in the past couple of months, thanks to firmer crude prices. However, if oil prices continue to remain range-bound, further appreciation in shares of ONGC and Oil India will be tough.

Growth in constant currency terms stood at 8.7% for tier-I IT companies in the December quarter, excluding Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., according to data collated by Nomura Research. Two quarters ago, growth stood at over 10%, and a year before that, growth was in the teens.Of course, that growth rates have been declining in the IT sector is well known and, as a result, IT stocks have underperformed the Nifty 50 index by around 18% in the past year.The moot question is if the December quarter results give signs of a possible turnaround. Investors will be disappointed there. Nomura’s analysts point out that growth in the key US region was the slowest in 12 quarters. Growth in some of the industry verticals that were doing well in previous quarters, such as retail, healthcare and telecom, slowed in the December quarter. And the performance of the largest industry vertical—banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI)—gave no hints of a turnaround. Besides, as US firms await the broad policy direction of the new government, there may be some delays in taking decisions.Of course, there are some silver linings. Companies, for instance, are sounding more optimistic, especially with regards to demand from BFSI. Besides, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities say the intensity with which some large corporations shifted work to captive units earlier has abated to an extent.But, from the looks of it, things are likely to go further south before any turnaround comes about. The recent appreciation in the rupee is likely to worsen matters for Indian IT companies. Profit margins have already been under pressure, owing to the increased investments in building digital capabilities and thanks to pricing pressure in the traditional application maintenance work. Besides, all of the noise against H1B visas in the US may result in new laws that increase costs of providing on-site services. Kotak’s analysts wrote in a note to clients, “In case the rupee were to sustain at current levels, we do highlight that many traditional levers of the industry are exhausted...

0.09,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""S3l"">Investors were underwhelmed by Accenture Plc’s results for the quarter ended February 2017. While revenue was more or less in line with expectations, new order bookings fell below expectations, and so did the company’s outlook for the consulting business. Accenture’s shares have fallen by around 4% since the results were announced last week. Some analysts have cheered the relatively higher growth in the company’s outsourcing business, suggesting this augurs well for India’s IT services industry. Outsourcing services grew 8% in constant currency terms last quarter, compared to 5% growth in consulting services. This is the first time in two years that Accenture’s outsourcing segment has outgrown its consulting practice. But as analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd point out, “(The outsourcing segment) is largely market share gain-driven and cannot be read positively from an Indian IT perspective, in our view.” In other words, the pickup in Accenture’s outsourcing business may well be coming at the expense of Indian IT, with which it competes directly. Worse still, the analysts add that the heightening of immigration fears could put the multinational firm in an advantageous position in this segment versus Indian IT, which is far more dependent on H-1B visas. Not very long ago, Indian investors were celebrating the fact that Tata Consultancy Services Ltd’s (TCS’s) market capitalization exceeded the combined value of Accenture and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Now, Accenture’s value exceeds that of TCS by around $5.5 billion. Note that Accenture’s new order bookings fell by 4% year-on-year and were below expectations. Growth in the key North American region fell to 4%, compared to double-digit growth a year ago. Company-wide growth has more-or-less halved in the past one year. These aren’t comforting signs for Indian IT, by any stretch of imagination. Some analysts see the relatively higher growth in Accenture’s outsourcing business as a positive for Indian IT, since it points to a shift in the nature of digital spends by customers, which may provide more opportunities for Indian companies. The argument goes that digital has moved beyond the consulting phase and is now scaling up, where Indian IT’s capabilities will be required. It would be prudent for investors to look for more datapoints that attest this. For now, what’s working in the favour of IT stocks is that since valuations are low when compared to the broad market, they have takers when stocks fall below a certain threshold. Although revenue growth has come down substantially, these companies still generate high amounts of cash, and have lately increased payout ratios.",2017-03-31,"The pickup in Accenture’s outsourcing business may well be coming at the expense of Indian IT firms, such as Infosys, TCS and Wipro",competitor,07:42,Is Accenture making things worse for Indian IT?

This was a question I had raised in <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/HUWtJbFU1xxKqIxUoQMO7M/Why-do-organizations-fail-in-large-numbers.html"" target=""_blank"">my last article</a>. The question that follows is: How does a nation-state build loyalty among its citizens? What can human resources professionals in various organizations learn from this?All strong nations have enemies they have fought multiple wars with. This column had earlier referred to the creation of out-groups to effectively consolidate the members of an in-group. Starting a war does a far more effective job of binding the nation together than the creation of an out-group. The famous historian Ian Morris, in his book <i>War! What Is It good For? </i>: <i>Conflict And The Progress Of Civilization From Primates To Robots</i>, has pointed out that, throughout history, by fighting wars, people have created larger, more organized societies that have gone on to be richer. Creation of conflict is integral to all great human movements too. Communism is not about peaceful coexistence of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie but a conflict between them. Organized religions know that the concepts of God and heaven are strong only when there is an equally strong concept of devil and hell as part of their belief systems. Most organizations have a vision of what they aspire to be. But very few have defined what they don’t want to be, the enemy they are at war with. Steve Jobs, in the “1984” launch commercial, made it clear that his organization was not interested in peaceful coexistence with other existing technology giants. At the outset he declared a war on technology that was not human friendly (read IBM and Microsoft). That belief is reflected even today in the design of Apple products. This also explains why Jobs and the brand he created continue to have a mass following of dedicated, aggressive fans.From the many wars that nation-states fight, heroes emerge. All strong nations have their national heroes—those who fought for its people, laid down their lives for the flag. Even after their death, nations ensure that these heroes are remembered. The history of nations is filled with stories of their valour. These stories help preserve the memories of the past for many generations of its citizens to come. How many organizations have a well thought out strategy to identify and project their heroes? Is there a process to collect their stories? Is there a mechanism to disseminate the inspiring stories, not just through formal training programmes, but also through water-cooler conversations? Why have nations not redesigned their flags or remixed their national anthems?Management experts who profess that “change is the only constant” forget the scientific fact—the human brain loves status quo. As Stephen Fleming of University College London says, whether it’s moving house or changing a TV channel, there is a considerable tendency for the human brain to stick with the current situation and choose not to act anew. When any action is repeated, the corresponding neural connections become stronger and over a point of time the brain gets to perform that action without even consciously thinking. The comfort of not thinking too much is disturbed by new stimuli. Political parties, organized religion and even god-men who manage to build strong loyalty with their followers have understood this brain fact. No political party or organized religion changes their symbols. Some of these symbols are thousands of years old. All godmen make sure that not just their attire, even their hairstyles remain constant over decades. And, organized religions have not allowed anyone to change even a comma in their holy books. But many organizations change their logos and other physical expressions at the drop of a hat. Such rebranding exercises are short cuts used by organizational leaders to show that they are making “visible” changes. Design agencies whose business thrives with every logo change will continue to give plausible arguments to prove that the new font and colours are far superior to the previous ones!Very few professional organizations have exploited the powers of consistency. To do that, organizational leaders should begin with a strong vision that has depth and width. They should know what expressions of that vision are permanent and what facets of that vision could change with the times. From its economic policies to global status to the demographic profile of its citizens, India has changed a lot. But the design of the national flag and the tune of its national anthem has always remained constant. Great nations understand the power of consistency. Nation-states do not try to build strong bonds with their citizens through financial incentives. The bond between all nations and their citizens is emotional. Political leaders know the power of emotional rewards over monetary rewards. And these emotional rewards are amplified through rituals. All nations have several rituals: standing up when the national anthem is sung, hoisting a flag, republic day parades—all add to strengthening the emotional bond between the nation and its citizen.An intuitive understanding of the core concepts of human behaviour has been used by nation leaders to build strong loyalty among its citizens. What prevents organizations from learning from these national leaders?<i>Biju Dominic is the chief executive officer of Final Mile Consulting, a behaviour architecture firm.</i><i>Comments are welcome at views@livemint.com</i>",2017-03-30,How does a nation-state build loyalty among its citizens?

-0.15,"New Delhi: The country’s third largest software services firm Wipro is learnt to have fired hundreds of employees as part of its annual “performance appraisal”. According to sources, Wipro has shown the door to about 600 employees, while speculation was rife that the number could go as high as 2,000.  At the end of December 2016, the Bengaluru-based company had over 1.79 lakh employees. When contacted, Wipro said it undertakes a “rigorous performance appraisal process” on a regular basis to align its workforce with business objectives, strategic priorities of the company, and client requirements. “The performance appraisal may also lead to the separation of some employees from the company and these numbers vary from year to year,” it added. The company, however, did not comment on the number of employees that have been asked to leave. Wipro said its comprehensive performance evaluation process includes mentoring, re-training and upskilling of employees. The company is scheduled to report its fourth quarter and full-year numbers on 25 April.The development comes at a time when Indian IT companies are facing an uncertain environment given the curbs being proposed on worker visa norms by various countries like the US, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand.These companies use temporary work visas to send employees to work on client sites. With visa programmes in these countries becoming more rigorous, Indian IT companies are likely to face challenges in movement of labour as well as a spike in operational costs. Indian IT companies get over 60% of their revenues from the North American market, about 20% from Europe and the remaining from other economies. Besides, higher adoption of technologies like automation and artificial intelligence is also reducing the need to have a large number of employees at client site.",2017-04-20,"Wipro is learnt to have sacked 600 employees as part of its annual ‘performance appraisal’, at a time when IT firms are facing curbs on work visas in US and Australia",competitor,22:17,600 Wipro employees sacked after performance appraisal: report
-1.0,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""S3l"">Mumbai: Dell Technologies, the company that was formed when Dell Inc. acquired EMC Corp. for $67 billion, remains bullish on its “long-term” growth prospects in India, which is the company’s third-largest market.“I think we are on track to hit the $3 billion revenue mark in this country in a couple of years,” Thomas Sweet, executive vice-president and chief financial officer (CFO), Dell Inc., said in an interview last week.Explaining why he is bullish on the Indian market, Sweet reasoned that the country now had “a government that is pro-growth, pro-development, and which is also pro-technology in helping to enable that growth and the government’s mission”. Further, he claimed that the Dell-EMC combine in India is growing faster than the domestic IT market growth. According to Nasscom’s Strategic Review 2017 report, in FY2017, India’s domestic IT-BPM (information technology-business process management) market is likely to grow 8.5% year on year to reach $38 billion (excluding e-commerce).To accelerate the pace of growth globally, Dell rolled out a distribution, or the so-called channel strategy in February. According to Sweet, half of the company’s revenue is routed through its distributors and his company hopes to increase their output with the recent reorganization it initiated to bring together the distribution partners of the erstwhile Dell and EMC companies.What the company did two months back, according to Sweet, was to merge the EMC and Dell sales forces (which existed as separate entities before the merger) into two units. One is an enterprise sales unit that would now focus on the top 3,000 customers, and the second is a commercial sales organization that will focus on an estimated 500,000 clients. Sweet said he is “pretty pleased” with how the combined sales units have shaped up so far.The company also plans to sharpen its focus on its digital transformation push. Dell Technologies breaks up digital transformation into three parts, according to Sweet: IT transformation-how IT can support what the business needs; security transformation-how a company can tackle multiple threats; and workforce transformation-how an organization makes its employees more productive in a mobile environment.In the past couple of years, most large technology solution providers such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. (HPE), International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), Accenture Plc., Oracle Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., Microsoft Corp. and others have been competing fiercely for the increasingly lucrative digital transformation pie. According to research firm International Data Corp. (IDC) forecasts, global spending on digital transformation technologies is projected to be more than $1.2 trillion in 2017—an increase of 17.8% over 2016.“There is clearly a greater focus among our customers on digital, but most of them are currently focused on IT transformation,” said Sweet. According to him, companies are looking to modernize their IT infrastructure to support cloud-native applications. In cloud computing, companies can consume IT services and only pay for the applications or infrastructure they use rather than buy the equipment upfront, thus reducing capital expenditure (capex).One change in the way technology adoption occurs in companies, according to Sweet, is the growing involvement of top management, especially when it comes to digital. “We are seeing more C-suite executives, particularly the chief executive officers (CEOs), chief operating officers (COOs) and CFOs, participating in the conversation on digital as, increasingly, they are seeking business solutions and business model evolution,” he said. The focus for CFOs, he said, continues to be on return on investment, even as most of them are also ready to bet on emerging technologies that are still not mature in order to future-proof their organizations.Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst of Greyhound Research, said that while the Dell-EMC combine has done a good job of “integrating the channel network” of both the organizations, managing the reskilling of the partners and introducing customised solutions tailored for specific industry segments may require an intensive focus, especially in the short term. “If they can manage this aspect well, they can have an edge in the digital transformation infrastructure market, where companies such as HPE and Lenovo have been showing renewed aggression of late,” he concluded.",2017-04-20,Dell Inc.

0.21,"Bengaluru:Rajiv Bansal, former CFO of Infosys, has dragged his former employer to arbitration to claim the remaining Rs12 crore of his severance pay. Infosys had agreed to pay Bansal a severance amount of Rs17.38 crore or 24 months of salary, but the company suspended payments after he got Rs5 crore as co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthy and others objected to the severance package as excessive. According to sources, Bansal has invoked his rights to an arbitral tribunal and a meeting is scheduled next month. This has opened another battle front for Infosys, which is already fighting visa clampdown by US President Donald Trump and global headwinds. When contacted, Bansal declined to comment. “The company has already clarified on the severance package for the former CFO Rajiv Bansal through a detailed statement. We do not have anything additional to add at this point,” Infosys said in an e-mailed response. Bansal’s severance payout has been one of the issues that Infosys founders had raised to allege governance lapses at the Bengaluru-based firm. When Bansal left Infosys in 2015, Infosys had agreed to pay him Rs17.38 crore in severance pay, equalling 24 months of pay. In February, Infosys chairman R. Seshasayee had clarified that of the agreed amount, only Rs5 crore have been paid so far and that the remaining was withheld pending clarifications on the terms of the severance contract. He had also admitted that the “judgement” could have differed if circumstances were different or if certain processes had been in place. Murthy had raised concerns about the hefty amount and questioned if the same was “hush money”.",2017-04-20,"Former Infosys CFO Rajiv Bansal asks for arbitration for settlement of his Rs17.38 crore severance pay, which hadn’t gone down well with Infosys founders",competitor,21:36,Infosys ex-CFO Rajiv Bansal seeks arbitration for severance pay: report
-0.31,"New Delhi:  Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka, whose pay package was a point of contention for the company’s founders, has drawn $ 6.68 million (about Rs 43 crore) or 61% of the promised compensation for the 2016-17 fiscal. Sikka was eligible for a $11 million pay including basic salary, variable pay, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock options for the year. Incidentally, this is also lower than what Sikka drew in the previous financial year when he took home Rs 48.73 crore. According to Infosys’ financial statements that outline compensation to key executives, Sikka received only $3.68 million of the $8 million variable component that he was promised. One of the highest paid executives in the Indian IT industry, Sikka took home $0.82 million in variable pay, $1.9 million in RSUs and ESOPs worth $0.96 million, totalling $3.68 million. Sikka’s salary was revised from $7.08 million to a handsome $11 million package with effect from April 2016, a move that did not go down well with the founders, including NR Narayana Murthy. The $11 million package was to include a base salary of $1 million and $2 million worth of stock annually as well $3 million in variable pay. Sikka is also eligible for another $5 million worth of performance-based equity and stock options upon achievement of certain performance targets.Also Read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/LqaRcR3cPS56WsvYnxZBxN/Vishal-Sikka-guaranteed-90-of-11-mn-salary-no-matter-how.html"">Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka guaranteed 90% of $11 million salary</a>“The Board, based on the recommendations of the Nominations Committee, approved on April 13, 2017, $0.82 million as variable pay to CEO for the year ended March 31, 2017,” Infosys said. It further mentions “...RSUs amounting to $1.9 million and ESOPs amounting to $0.96 million representing the performance-based equity and stock options for the financial year 2017”. While the founders had raised concerns over the significant salary hike given to Sikka, the Board, on its part, maintained that the variable component was tied to steep performance goals. However, Infosys has not made those goals public. Infosys had defended Sikka’s pay hike saying all decisions were made “in the overall interest of the company”. Infosys’ performance of 2016-17 has disappointed the street, especially after it lowered its annual revenue guidance thrice last fiscal. The “aspirational goal” of $20 billion revenue by 2020 set by Infosys looks like a tall order given the current performance, said industry watchers. The Bengaluru-based firm, which posted a revenue of $ 10.2 billion in 2016-17, has been focussing on new areas like automation and artificial intelligence to bolster its revenues to meet the said target.

-0.72,"New Delhi: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) missed analysts’ estimates for both revenue and profit in the fourth fiscal quarter, even as India’s largest software services firm’s full-year sales rose 6.2% to $17.58 billion.The company reported revenue of $4.45 billion in the three months ended 31 March, a 1.5% increase from the preceding quarter and 5.8% from the year-ago period. Net profit totalled $992 million, a 0.8% decline on a sequential basis and an increase of 5.8% from the year-ago period.A <i>Bloomberg</i> survey of 30 analysts had estimated TCS to report quarterly revenue of $4.62 billion and net profit of $1.03 billion in the quarter.Also read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/GKOA2xer3PawhCAAQjlQCP/TCS-unperturbed-by-possible-changes-to-H1B-visa-regime-CEO.html"">TCS unperturbed by possible changes to H1B visa regime</a>“FY17 was a year of broad-based growth amid economic and political turbulence in our key markets,” said Rajesh Gopinathan, who took over as chief executive of TCS in February. “We believe we are better placed for the year-ahead,” said Gopinathan, who spent much time on the numbers, suggesting that the new CEO will take time to probably replicate the success managed by his predecessor N. Chandrasekaran, the current chairman of Tata Sons Ltd. At the heart of TCS’s underperformance is the company’s inability to generate more business from its largest customers, banks, in its largest market, the US. TCS’s  banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) segment, which accounts for over 40% of its revenue, grew 4.8% from a year earlier in constant currency terms. North America, which brings 54% of its business, reported a 4.3% rise.TCS does not give quarterly or annual forecasts but a few equity analysts are sceptical about the company’s prospects. The January-March quarter marks the 10th straight quarter (the company has recorded slow growth since July 2014) in which TCS has either underperformed, or at best managed to keep up with estimates. “Looking at this protracted slowdown, I believe TCS has reached a point where unless the company really brings about a change in the way it has done business, it will be tough for the company to ever beat street expectations,” said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage, on the condition of anonymity. “At best it can match street expectations.”TCS’s performance mirrors the poor show put up by Infosys Ltd last week, and this is worrying for three reasons.First, both growth and profitability for Indian IT firms is under pressure. Mumbai-based TCS reported a full-year increase of 8.3% in constant currency terms, similar to the full-year growth reported by Bengaluru-based Infosys (with $10.21 billion in revenue) although Infosys reported a higher 7.4% expansion in dollar revenue.Like Infosys, TCS’s growth in 2016-17 was slower than in 2015-16: TCS’s revenue growth in constant currency terms was 3.6 percentage points slower than the 11.9% increase in 2015-16. TCS added $1.03 billion in incremental revenue in the year ended 31 March 2017, less than $1.09 billion added in new business in 2015-16 when it reported a 7.1% increase and half of the $2.01 billion in new business added in 2014-15. TCS’s operating margin in the January-March quarter and for the full year stood at 25.7%. Operating margin narrowed 80 basis points from 26.5% in 2015-16, again similar to Infosys, which too saw its profitability eroded as commoditized outsourcing contracts see intense pricing pressure.Despite falling short of its operating margin forecast of 26-28% in the last financial year, the company’s management retained this guidance for the current fiscal year, which at least two analysts say will be “impossible to achieve”.“In this kind of environment, where most companies want more skilled people at client-facing sides, when most countries are adopting a protectionist stance, it looks impossible to keep operating in that band,” a Mumbai-based analyst at a foreign brokerage said, requesting anonymity.Second, despite higher growth in digital, which remains a fuzzy word, and the success of new and renew strategy rolled out by CEO Vishal Sikka to revive Infosys, both companies continue to be plagued by anaemic growth. This has made many analysts question if existing traditional contracts are merely getting rebadged as digital. A case in point: TCS claims its digital business grew 29% in the last year and now brings $3 billion in business.Finally, both TCS and Infosys continue to shy away from acquiring technology-focused firms. Infosys has not made a single acquisition in the last 18 months; TCS has looked away from acquiring a company since it partnered with Japan’s Mitsubishi Group in 2014. This is important because most large technology firms, including Accenture Plc, are looking at acquisitions to bring in new technology and skill sets. Nevertheless, the quarter does have some positives. For starters, the TCS management claimed that its insurance business under Diligenta and Japan has turned the corner, with Gopinathan expressing confidence of growth from these two lagging business units.On Tuesday, TCS shares fell 0.53% to Rs2,308.65 on BSE, while the benchmark Sensex declined 0.32% to 29,319.1 points.

The company’s March quarter results announcement was no different. Revenue grew 1% sequentially in constant currency terms, lower than analysts’ estimates of around 1.6% growth.

TCS has been saying for the past few months that things are looking up in the US and particularly in the BFSI segment. Over 40% of its revenues come from the BFSI segment, while the North American region accounted for 54% of revenues last year.But after the March quarter performance, investors are likely to question the company’s optimism. As the chart alongside shows, year-on-year growth rates have fallen significantly at TCS in the past year. Besides, operating profit margin, too, has fallen below its targeted range of 26-28%. The result of this double whammy was that earnings per share grew by just 8.3% last year.With the rupee having appreciated sharply compared to the average rate in fiscal year 2017 (FY17), margins are expected to be under further pressure in the new fiscal year. What’s more, thanks to the many changes in H-1B visa rules and policies, costs of providing on-site services to clients are also expected to rise. As such, earnings can be under pressure in FY18. Against this backdrop, TCS shares trade at around 16 times one-year forward earnings. And while CEO Gopinathan said that he expects FY18 to be incrementally positive, things could turn out to be particularly dire, depending on new visa rules. “We see near-term impact on decision-making due to immigration-related issues, even as companies are denying this. We expect 1QFY18 to start slowly and do not build growth acceleration in FY18,” analysts at Nomura Research wrote in a note to clients. Some of the possible impact of new visa norms is detailed here: bit.ly/2ngI48H.And unlike TCS’s upbeat post-results commentary, most other technology companies including Accenture Plc. have guided for slower growth in the new fiscal year. Besides, while Infosys Ltd tried to soothe investors’ nerves by outlining a detailed capital allocation policy, TCS said it will stay with its existing payout policy.In sum, there’s nothing much to like in TCS’s March quarter results announcement, except perhaps for the management’s hopeful commentary. But given the fair bit of divergence between the company’s outlook three months ago and its actual performance, investors would do well to tread cautiously.",2017-04-19,"After the March quarter performance, investors are likely to question the optimism being shown by new TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan",competitor,07:25,"TCS results: Upbeat commentary, downbeat performance in March quarter"

The H1B visa programme is most sought-after by Indian IT firms and professionals to work on customer sites.

Any change in visa norms can affect the movement of labour as well as spike operational costs for IT players. Most Indian IT companies get over 60% of their revenues from the North American market. The Indian government, on its part, has said it will take up the issue with the American authorities during the upcoming visit of finance minister Arun Jaitley to the US. Another industry body Assocham also expressed concern over the tightening of the visa norms. “...Indian IT companies are bound to face disruptions by way of higher costs and even some laying off work force back home, as the rising rupee is aggravating the situation further for the technology export firms,” it said. Indian IT firms, however, put a brave face to the impending changes being mooted by the US. “We continue to invest in the local communities in which we operate, including hiring local American top talent, bringing education and training to our clients to shrink the skills gap in the US, and working with policymakers to foster innovation,” Infosys said in a statement. Larger rival TCS, too, has exuded confidence that these issues can be tackled through greater engagement. It has also said it will “tweak” its business model to continue to be in compliance with regulations. With rising protectionism across markets like the US, Singapore and now Australia, companies are beginning to adjust their business models to reduce their dependence on visas, hiring more locals instead.

-0.69,"Taipei: President Donald Trump just made life a little easier for Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai. And a lot harder for Vishal Sikka and Rajesh Gopinathan.“Right now, H1B visas are being awarded in a totally random lottery. And that’s wrong,” Trump told workers in Wisconsin, announcing a reform of the visa category. “Instead, they should be given to the most skilled and highest paid applicants.”Whatever your views on Trump, he is factually correct on that last point. H1Bs are supposed to go to those working in an occupation that requires “theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge.”It’s hard to make a case that the jobs being filled by the Indian IT outsourcing firms that dominate H1B visa issuance—such as Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys Ltd, which Sikka and Gopinathan helm—make use of highly specialized knowledge when they regularly pay less than other firms like Apple Inc. or Google parent Alphabet Inc.On the first point, Trump’s a little off, though, because the awarding of H1Bs isn’t a totally random lottery: A 2015 amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act outlined a pecking order the secretary of labour is meant to follow. The 65,000 annual cap is also exceeded because of exceptions and rollovers that put the annual figure at over 180,000 last year.The flood of H1B applications does make the reviewing and awarding of visas a slow process. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services centre in California is only now processing applications made back in August, for example.That’s bad for companies like Apple and Google, led by Cook and Pichai, which seek far fewer H1Bs. I’ve written before of employees being parked offshore while they await the correct paperwork, and the risks to the US of this situation continuing.In tightening the rules—he can’t unilaterally rewrite them—Trump will help those tech titans that really need the talent, as evidenced by them paying such high salaries for their H1B workers.Yet he won’t be doing much for manufacturers like tool maker Snap-on Inc, where he delivered his broadside. That’s because factories in Asia still offer cost benefits over the US, and Trump’s decision to trade a weaker Chinese currency for assistance on North Korea shows how hard he’s willing to push Beijing in the effort to ease the plight of American workers.By making bold statements about H1Bs, Trump has played to his working-class support base but also diverted attention away from dependence on Chinese manufacturing.

Many seeds for the future have been sown and we see the green shoots in many areas—in AI, in automation, with initiatives like design thinking. That said, the transformation is a work in progress. Some things aren’t working as intended and course corrections are being applied. There are pockets of underperformance which represent opportunities. We need to rapidly scale up things that are working. There are capability gaps that need to be fixed. But overall, I am optimistic about our prospects.<p class=""question"">How will the co-chair arrangement work? How will you delineate roles to make sure there’s no overlap?Sesh (R. Seshasayee) and I have known each other for 20 years and worked on the Infy board for six years, so we are quite comfortable with each other. We have decided that there are some areas that he will continue to lead such as overall leadership of the board or investor outreach while in other areas like strategy or talent I will work more closely with Vishal and his team. We have decided that we will work as partners rather than compartments.<p class=""question"">What are your immediate priorities?My first priority is to help align all stakeholders around the transformation journey that we are on. The second is to work closely with Vishal in helping build a world class leadership team that can execute the transformation strategy.Your elevation has been seen positively and the general view is that relations between the board and the founders will improve now. What’s your take on that and how do you intend to repair relations with the founders?I have the greatest respect for the founders of Infosys and especially for Mr (N.R. Narayana) Murthy who has been a mentor and friend for a long time. I believe that everyone wants the same thing—which is to see Infosys flourish and prosper from the incredible opportunities that are being thrown up by technology shifts. The board and leadership team wants this. Investors want this. Employees want this. The founders want this. However, this is a journey through uncharted waters and so the key is to earn the trust of all stakeholders so we stay together through the ups and downs of this voyage. Trust really is the key. This requires intense, honest and ongoing dialogue. It also requires courage, willingness to experiment, assimilate feedback, learn and change.After a stellar year in 2015-16, the last 12 months have been slow by Infy’s lofty standards. What in your opinion needs to be fixed immediately in order to get back the company to industry-leading growth?This has been a tough year for everyone with growth slowing and severe commoditization. Infy’s performance must be seen not just in absolute terms but in the context of the industry. Vishal has already commented on our performance and what he and the team will do. I personally believe we have to more aggressively move investments and our brightest people from more commoditized areas towards our best growth prospects which are in areas such as digital, cyber security, AI, IOT and so on. Our job as a board is to support management in moving much more quickly on the many opportunities we have.Will you reduce your other board commitments now that you’re taking up this role? Will you remain chairman at BoB?The transformation of BoB is also a work in progress. (P.S.) Jayakumar and his team have worked really hard and we are seeing the green shoots of their labour.

-0.61,"Mumbai: For Grishma, an Indian software designer, President Donald Trump’s review of the visa programme for bringing highly skilled workers into the United States comes at a bad time.Fresh from gaining a master’s degree in Europe, and with an offer of employment from a well-known US design firm, she was well on her way to fulfilling the ambition of many young Indian IT workers—a dream job in America.But as she waits in the H1B visa queue for the green light, she is caught in a bind. “It’s a weird time to be applying, with all the scrutiny,” said Grishma, who gave only her first name for fear of jeopardising her chances of getting a visa.The United States has already suspended the “expedited processing option” for applicants, under which she may have received a visa in weeks. More broadly, uncertainty over the review announced this week has unsettled Grishma and many others like her.She will have to wait until at least around August to learn her fate, but having accepted the US job offer she is not in a position to apply for positions elsewhere, including in Europe. “It’s pretty debilitating,” Grishma told <i>Reuters</i>. “I’d like to start work to mitigate the financial damage.”Trump’s decision was not a huge surprise, given his election campaign pledge to put American jobs first.Also read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Politics/4ItpsVUuXrtimX2wLZXlnL/H1B-visa-curbs-India-threatens-US-with-trade-retaliation.html"">H-1B visa curbs—India talks tough, signals it may hit back at US</a>But the executive order he signed, though vague in many areas, has prompted thousands of foreign workers already in the United States or applying for visas to work there to re-think their plans. Companies who send them also face huge uncertainty.The concerns are particularly acute in India, where IT firms like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd are top beneficiaries of the H1B visa programme, using it to send computer engineers to service clients in the United States, their largest overseas market.Companies and staff realignExperts say Trump’s order to review visa processes is aimed at firms like TCS, Infosys and Wipro, which from 2005-14 snagged around 86,000 H1B visas, roughly equivalent to the number of H1B visas the United States issues in total each year.Two industry people aware of the matter said Infosys, India’s no. 2 information technology (IT) services company, is applying for just under 1,000 H1B visas this year, which one of the people said was down from 6,500 applications in 2016 and some 9,000 in 2015.It was not clear whether the sharp reduction in 2017 was in direct response to Trump’s presidency, although the company has said for some time it wanted to cut dependence on “fly-in” staff. TCS, Infosys and Wipro said they would not share data on the number of H1B visas they had applied for this year.With fewer visas going to Infosys, more might become available for smaller IT companies and big US tech companies, like Facebook and Microsoft Corp, that typically send in fewer H1B applications each year.US-based immigration lawyer Murali Bashyam, managing partner of Bashyam Spiro LLP which advises and works with small to mid-sized Indian IT firms, said clients had been in contact seeking clarity, while the number of visa applicants had fallen.“I think the reason for that is they get the sense that it’s going to get so much tougher to comply with all of the changes ... that it might not be worth their money,” he said. “There is a fear that radical immigration changes are coming, and if those radical immigration changes come then it could completely change the way IT staffing companies do business.”Bashyam said the number of people on H1B visas already working in the United States who were considering returning to their home country had risen.An engineer working at Cisco, who has been in the United States since 2011, said that three months ago he would not have considered returning to India. But the review of the visa system, and any rule change that revoked the right for his wife to work in the United States on a dependent visa, could force him to change his mind.“If that happens, then I would definitely be interested in going back to India. Even though I’m secure, I don’t want to be in a situation where my wife cannot work,” said the engineer, who declined to be named. “Those who have heavily invested here, who’ve bought houses, property and are still on visas, are afraid.”‘I’m looking eastward’According to Bashyam, some Indians on H1B visas were cancelling plans to return home to visit their families in case they had problems getting back into the United States. “With everything that’s going on, travelling outside the US is the biggest fear for a lot of the H1B workers working in the IT staffing industry,” he said.And the uncertainty is not limited to IT. Trump’s campaign rhetoric around tighter visa rules has led some Indian students considering studying abroad to look beyond the United States, which typically draws in over 1,00,000 Indian students annually.One Canadian official said the number of student visa applications for certain courses in Canada had spiked over 250% since Trump’s election win in November.Akshay Baliga, a management consultant with a H1B visa that is valid until 2018, said he was not considering returning to the United States for work any time soon. “As a professional I’m looking eastward,” said Baliga, now based in India but who earlier studied and lived for years in America.

0.16,"New Delhi: State-run Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) on Tuesday signed an agreement with the Rajasthan government to set up a 9 million tonne joint venture refinery at a cost of Rs43,129 crore, a statement from oil ministry said. HPCL will hold 74% equity in the joint venture, HPCL Rajasthan Refinery Ltd, while the state government will hold the balance. The agreement signed in the presence of oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje entitles the company to a viability gap funding of Rs1,123 crore a year for 15 years from the year of commercial production. The funding will be in the form of an interest-free loan to be refunded in subsequent 15 years.The project includes a petrochemicals complex too. The proposed refinery will be able to process local crude from Vedanta Ltd’s Barmer oil field in the state as well as imported crude. Vedanta, which recently merged its group company Cairn India Ltd with itself, is planning more investments into enhanced oil recovery from its Barmer assets. Anil Agarwal, chairman, Vedanta Group had last December said the group was committed to investing Rs30,000 crore to add 100,000 barrels of oil and oil equivalent over the next three years, primarily from its prolific Rajasthan fields.For the proposed refinery, the state has already allotted 4,800 acres at Pachpadra in Barmer. The statement said quoting Pradhan that construction work will begin in the current financial year and will be completed in four years. Separately, another deal was signed between Rajasthan State Gas Ltd and GAIL Gas Ltd for creating a city gas network in Kota district.

However, the appreciation is attributable less to its performance and more to anticipation that Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (the company’s telecom business) may perform better than expected.When RIL announces its March quarter results too, investors will be keenly watching out for updates on Jio, apart from the company’s downstream projects and its capex plans. Its March quarter results are expected to be good despite the fact that the benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) has declined about 5% sequentially to $6.4 a barrel. Analysts expect RIL to report better GRMs during the March quarter.According to analysts at Nomura Research, RIL’s premium to Singapore GRM will likely improve (the December quarter had a shutdown of the fluidized catalytic cracking unit; also Brent-Dubai crude spreads were favourable). “Petchem (petrochemical) earnings will likely increase further both as Reliance benefits from higher volumes (new capacities) and firmed up margins particularly in aromatics chain,” pointed out Nomura’s March quarter preview for the oil and gas sector.GRM is the realization from turning every barrel of crude oil into finished products and is an important measure of profitability for refining firms.Even as RIL’s numbers may bring good tidings, expectations from oil marketing companies (OMCs)—Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd—are not rosy. Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd expect weaker earnings for OMCs due to inventory losses in both refining and marketing, and lower core GRMs year-on-year. With oil prices declining towards the end of the March quarter, OMCs are expected to report inventory losses. However, “full year consolidated earnings should surprise positively, particularly for HPCL and BPCL, due to strong performance in subsidiaries in FY17 vs FY16”, said Jefferies in a report to clients on 6 April.On an average, crude oil prices rose year-on-year and that will reflect positively in price realizations of upstream companies such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltd. Investors will have to keep a tab on output numbers and production outlook in the near future.

Now, an analyst at a foreign brokerage has suggested that the company is better off without the target.ALSO READ: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Money/JbzPzyPMJdV4ZBhqSyxkbK/Has-Infosyss-recovery-dissipated-before-it-even-started.html"" target=""_blank"">Has Infosys’s recovery dissipated before it even started?</a>“Management continues to maintain ‘aspirational’ revenue and margin targets that are increasingly becoming unlikely to be achieved, in our opinion. Given Infy (Infosys) is now guiding to lower levels of both revenue growth and margins in FY18 (2017-18), we think management would be well-served to either amend or drop its aspirational targets,” Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 April. Based on its <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/hI2j9yckPHHX6PkEuKU2PK/Infosys-Q4-earnings-subdued-guidance-lower-for-201718.html"" target=""_blank"">guidance for 2017-18</a>, issued last week, Infosys expects to end the year with revenue of between $10.8 billion and $11.3 billion. Infosys maintains this target is an ambition and the management has no plans to dump it.In April 2015, Infosys first outlined its ambitious target: India’s second largest software firm wanted to become a $20 billion firm with 30% operating margin and to generate $80,000 in revenue from every employee working on a project.  In 2016, it tweaked the deadline to 2020-21. Infosys ended financial year 2015 with $8.7 billion in revenue, 25.9% in operating margin and generated $52,300 per employee.Two years later, Infosys managed a compound annual growth rate of 8.25% to increase its revenue to $10.21 billion but operating margin declined by 120 basis points to 24.7% and revenue per employee slipped to $51,400, making many question CEO Vishal Sikka’s strategy.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Not that Sikka hasn’t delivered. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17;  for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been  the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the “impossible targets.” “The industry is going through a structural change, and to make it worse, you set yourself impossible targets,” said a former EVP, who quit last year. “A large component of a senior executive’s salary is tied to company’s annual growth, which itself is linked to the long-term target.”Infosys says it outlined a target to make its employees work towards a goal and eventually help script a turnaround.“We gave this target because we believed this would help motivate employees, and help the CEO make them work towards a goal,” one board member, who was part of the goal-setting exercise, said on  condition of anonymity. “Looking back, I’m still not sure if it was a wrong step. I’m still on the fence,  thinking how and what we could have done better to make sure hopes did not run high and employees did not come under pressure.”One of the things Infosys could have avoided was linking Sikka’s salary to the target, said the second executive who quit, a former SVP. This seemed to suggest that  this was much more than an aspirational target, as the CEO himself has repeatedly said. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/nZzaphFLFUOqP1EuegR9EL/Infosys-CEO-Vishal-Sikka-takes-home-only-61-of-eligible-pay.html"" target=""_blank"">A weak performance in this year hurt Sikka</a>, who earned $6.8 million in 2016-17, less than the $7.3 million he earned in 2015-16.

Cyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltd moved the NCLAT on Wednesday against the 6 March order by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that the petition was non-maintainable, said two people aware of the development who requested anonymity.The office of Mistry, who was ousted as Tata Sons chairman on 24 October, declined to comment. <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/1IO7g0PBh6Z4S0D52hQuUP/NCLT-says-Mistry-family-firms-petition-not-maintainable.html"" target=""_blank"">NCLT had ruled that Cyrus Investments and Sterling Investments were not qualified to file the petition</a> alleging mismanagement and oppression of minority shareholders at Tata Sons, the holding company of the $103 billion Tata group.“The petitioners have failed to convince the court that the application is maintainable,” said B.S.V. Kumar, presiding member of NCLT, in the March order. Under the new Companies Act, shareholders are required to hold 10% equity to be qualified to file such a petition. The Act does not define equity to mean only ordinary equity.The two Mistry firms own a combined 18.4% of ordinary equity shares of the Tata group holding firm, but their holding falls below 10% when preference shares are taken into account. According to the Tatas, Mistry firms hold only about 2.17% then.Later, in an order passed on 17 April, NCLT said it would not waive the 10% requirement for the Mistry firms to file the petition. It makes sense for Mistry’s firms to approach the appellate body on maintainability and waiver separately as the legal arguments put forward on the two issues were different, said Ramesh Vaidyanathan, founder and managing partner at Advaya Legal, a law firm.The plea on maintainability was based on the fact that equity shareholding of the Mistry firms is above the threshold of 10%. The waiver arguments were on why the tribunal should waive the threshold requirement, said Vaidyanathan. While arguing in favour of the waiver, the Mistry firms had cited concerns on voting and veto rights accorded to Tata trustees on the board of Tata Sons.“Assuming that the petitioners are likely to approach the tribunal on waiver and main petition being dismissed, the tribunal may consider merging the appeal against dismissal of maintainability and waiver. This is because the urgency to deal with this matter is no longer there,” added Vaidyanathan. As the final order of the 17 April hearing is yet to be released, the firms could not have clubbed the waiver and maintainability petitions, said the first of the two people cited earlier. In a setback to Mistry and his family firms, the NCLT in its 17 April hearing not only refused to grant a waiver from the shareholding requirement, but also <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/6FpejrVtvJSI0rjb5SC0vO/NCLT-dismisses-Cyrus-Mistry-petitions-against-Tata-Sons.html"" target=""_blank"">dismissed the main petition alleging mismanagement and oppression</a>.The appellate authority typically doesn’t interfere with a decision by the lower authority unless there’s been a gross injustice, said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner at law firm IC Legal. “They (Mistry camp) really will have to bring in something substantial to the appellate tribunal to override the ruling of the lower authority,” he said.

-0.35,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""A5l"">At first glance, the letter from the Delhi police commissioner’s desk could have easily been dismissed as  another routine laundry list of his department’s “achievements” in the previous year.A closer look at the letter, written a little over two years ago, would have sprung a pleasant surprise in the context of the city police’s technology prowess.The Delhi Police, according to the letter, had partnered with the Indian Space Research Organisation to implement CMAPS—Crime Mapping, Analytics and Predictive System—under the “Effective use of Space Technology-based Tools for Internal Security Scheme” initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014.CMAPS generates crime-reporting queries and has the capacity to identify crime hotspots by auto sweep on the Dial 100 database every 1-3 minutes, replacing a Delhi Police crime-mapping tool that involved manual gathering of data every 15 days. It performs trend analysis, compiles crime and criminal profiles and analyses the behaviour of suspected offenders—all with accompanying graphics. CMAPs also has a security module for VIP threat rating, based on vulnerability of the potential target and the security deployed, and advanced predictive analysis, among other features.A prototype of the standalone version was installed at the Delhi Police control room in June 2015. The software’s statistical models and algorithms today help the police carry out “predictive policing” to forecast where the next crime is likely to occur, much like in cities such as London, Los Angeles, Kent and Berlin.That’s just one example of how technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily lives—whether it’s policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains.Fintech start-up Lendingkart Technologies has developed tools based on big data analytics to help lenders evaluate borrowers’ creditworthiness. Using these tools, its sister company Lendingkart Finance Ltd aims to transform small business lending by providing easy access to credit for small and medium enterprises.The “technology platform has helped create a highly operational efficiency model that enables swift loan disbursement within 72 hours of loan application. Over 120,000 SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) have till date reached out to Lendingkart Finance for their credit needs,” the company said.Accenture Labs and Akshaya Patra, the world’s largest NGO-run midday meal programme, said on Thursday that they had partnered in a project to “exponentially increase the number of meals served to children in schools in India that are run and aided by the government”.Using “disruptive technology”, they hope to potentially “improve efficiency by 20%, which could boost the number of meals served by millions”.Accenture Labs began the project with a “strategic assessment and design thinking, then developed a prototype for improving kitchen operations and outcomes”. An example of Akshaya Patra’s transformation, according to Thursday’s statement, was its move “from manual collection of feedback from children and schools to a more efficient technology-based solution” that involved the use of blockchain (the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin) and sensor-enabled devices to gather feedback digitally, and use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to “predict the next day’s meal requirements”. Consider another example. Until even early 2015, the thousands of distributors of consumer goods firm Marico Ltd in Mumbai used to place orders and wait “almost a day” before getting the goods delivered. Now it takes just 10-15 minutes for an order to be delivered, helping them stock fewer goods. In turn, the lower inventory helps them cut down on warehouse space and pare costs, besides reducing the waiting time for trucks. All these distributors have benefited from <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/PkjAud0lcXFc2H9egy0JQP/Marico-taps-analytics-for-growth.html"" target=""_blank"">an analytics-driven Order Management Execution System that the company launched in December 2014</a>.Big Data and the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) are intimately connected: billions of Internet-connected “things” will, by definition, generate massive amounts of data. By 2020, the world would have generated around 40 zettabytes of data, or 5,127 gigabytes per individual, according to an estimate by research firm International Data Corp. It’s no wonder that in 2006, market researcher Clive Humby declared data to be “the new oil”. Companies are sharpening their focus on analysing this deluge of data to understand consumer behaviour patterns. A report by software body Nasscom and Blueocean Market Intelligence, a global analytics and insight provider, predicts that the Indian analytics market will cross the $2 billion mark by this fiscal year.Companies are using Big Data analytics for everything—driving growth, reducing costs, improving operations and recruiting better people.A major portion of orders of e-commerce firms now come through their analytics-driven systems. These firms record the purchasing behaviour of buyers and customize things for them. Travel firms, on their part, use data analytics to understand their customers—from basic things like their travel patterns, the kind of hotels they like to stay in, who their typical co-travellers are, their experiences—all geared to giving the customer a personalized experience the next time the customer visits the website.In hospitals, intelligence derived from data helps improve patient care through quicker and more accurate diagnoses, drug dosage recommendations and the prediction of potential side effects. Millions of electronic medical records, public health data and claims records are being analysed.Predictive healthcare using wearables to check vital medical signs and remote diagnostics could cut patient waiting times, according to a 13 January report by the McKinsey Global Institute. International Business Machines Corp.’s Watson, a cluster of computers that combines artificial intelligence and advanced analytics software and works as a “question answering” system, is being used for a variety of applications, most notably in oncology, the branch of medicine that deals with cancer. Watson for Oncology helps physicians quickly identify key information in a patient’s medical records, sift through tons of data and come up with most optimal medical choices.Many companies globally and in India, including some start-ups, are using machine-learning tools to infuse intelligence in their business by using predictive models. Popular machine-learning applications include Google’s self-driving car, online recommendations from e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Flipkart, online dating service Tinder and streaming video platform Netflix. Railigent, Siemens AG’s platform for the predictive maintenance for trains, listens to the trains running over its sensors and can detect, from the sound of the wheels, which wheel is broken and when it should be replaced.Predictive algorithms are used in recruitment too. Aspiring Minds, for instance, uses algorithms powered by machine learning that draw on data to address complex issues—for instance, to accurately gauge the quality of speech in various accents against a neutral accent (also using natural language processing). This helps companies improve recruitment efficiency by over 35% and reduce voice evaluation costs by 55%.Artificial intelligence, machine-learning-based algorithms and anomaly-detection techniques will need to be used to monitor activity across networks and real-time data streams, consulting firms point out. These technologies will, for instance, let banks in India identify threats as they occur while maintaining low false positive alarm rates even for new types of threats.There are still challenges in bringing about wider technology adoption.“Our survey showed that only about 4% of companies across industries have the capabilities to use advanced data analytics to deliver tangible business value. While some oil and gas companies have invested in their analytics capabilities, many struggle to get their arms around this powerful new opportunity,” said a March 2014 note by Bain and Co..“We often find that senior executives understand the concepts around Big Data and advanced analytics, but their teams have difficulty defining the path to value creation and the implications for technology strategy, operating model and organization. Too often, companies delegate the task of capturing value from better analytics to the IT department, as a technology project,” the note pointed out.In the 2006 movie <i>Deja Vu</i>, law enforcement agents investigate an explosion on a ferry that kills over 500 people, including a large group of party-going sailors.

-0.25,"New Delhi: The ministry of electronics and IT on Thursday issued guidelines on setting up of IT infrastructure by government departments using cloud computing technology with a clause mandating that all data must be stored within the country. The guidelines for government departments on contractual terms related to cloud services said since the data can be located in one or more discrete sites in foreign countries, therefore, the condition for data location has to be specifically mentioned in the agreement with the service provider. “The terms and conditions of the Empanelment of the Cloud Service Provider has taken care of this requirement by stating that all services including data will be guaranteed to reside in India,” the guidelines said. The cloud computing service enables its user to hire or use software, storage, servers as per requirement instead of purchasing the whole system. Meity has empanelled 11 companies for providing cloud computing services to government departments which include Microsoft Corp., Hewlett Packard, IBM India ,Tata Communications, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), Net Magic IT Services, Sify Technologies and CtrlS Data Centers. Cloud computing can help government departments expand capacity of their IT system as per need and even for short period and quickly start any online service. The cloud computing system can be of help to departments specially in handling sudden load of web traffic generated to access their websites like in case of train ticket booking, form filling or tax submission on a last date etc. “...the department is required to move away from the traditional fixed payment model to a variable pricing / utility pricing model where the department pays for the resources it actually uses during that period. The payment terms have to be structured accordingly to pay only for the resources used by the department,” a separate set of guideline issued for cloud services procurement said. The guidelines on cloud computing follows MeghRaj Policy (cloud policy) to provide strategic direction for adoption of cloud services by the government. The aim of the cloud policy is to realise a comprehensive vision of a government cloud (GI Cloud) environment available for use by central and state government line departments, districts and municipalities to accelerate their ICT-enabled service improvements. As per the guidelines, both cloud service provider (CSP) and government department will have to share responsibility for the managing services provisioned using cloud computing facility.“The CSP’s part in this shared responsibility includes providing its services on a highly secure and controlled platform and providing a wide array of security features customers can use. The departments’ responsibility includes configuring their IT environments in a secure and controlled manner for their purposes,” the guideline said.",2017-04-20,"Meity has empanelled 11 companies for providing cloud computing services to government departments which include Microsoft , IBM India  and  BSNL",competitor,23:13,Govt IT data on cloud system must be stored within India: Meity
-0.55,"<p xmlns:fn=""http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"" class=""S3l"">Early in the morning of Monday, 3 April, serendipity sat me next to N.R. Narayana Murthy on a long transcontinental flight leaving Bengaluru. As the flight attendants handed out newspapers for the passengers to read while on the journey, I couldn’t help but notice that Murthy had made front-page news, this time for questioning the extent of the raise given to an executive at Infosys Ltd, the company that he founded over three decades ago along with a few of his junior colleagues. I turned to him and we began a conversation. I shall not focus here on the specific comments about Infosys, but there were several parts of the conversation that covered Murthy’s philosophy around topics that I have written about in this column before, and which provide insights into the character of the man. Unsurprisingly, we spoke of the social issues being caused by the changes in the way corporations recruit and retain talent. We spoke of organizations such as TopCoder, now part of an Indian IT services firm after the acquisition of its parent by Wipro. TopCoder is a marketplace for computer programmers, who can get compensated for their work through this marketplace without ever having to be an employee of a services firm. It is like a taxi aggregator among programming firms. I have written in this column before about how marketplaces like these can eventually change the construct of the employer-employee contract now prevalent among many firms and have also mused about whether unionization may be around the corner at some Indian IT services firms as the employer-employee relationship construct begins to disintegrate.Murthy explained that there are circumstances where unions can play a pivotal role in ensuring equity. He said the fact that unions look out for employees’ welfare is inescapable, and proffered the example of the US. According to him, when unionization covered 35% of the American workforce, American labour was better looked after. Now that this figure has slipped to around 15%, the poor have become poorer as corporations and their leaders have followed an Ayn-Rand-esque view of “rational self-interest” and social Darwinism. Pushing crumbs off one’s table and trusting that the aspiring classes in society will have enough is a sure recipe in fomenting labour class unrest, as the recent Brexit and US presidential elections have shown. Murthy’s opinion is that such unrest is also lying dormant and is barely beneath the surface in India, and that leaders of India’s capitalist revolution cannot afford to blithely ignore this.Also read | <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Companies/lFfFABxwjGRidEEKm39X8K/Infosys-justifies-pay-hike-for-COO-says-effective-rise-only.html"" target=""_blank"">Infosys strongly defends COO pay hike criticized by Narayana Murthy</a>We also spoke of the fledgling experiments with universal basic income (UBI) that have begun to pop up in various corners of the earth. UBI is essentially a dole paid out to every citizen, whether they are out of work or not, in a nod to the fact that relentless mechanization and automation will take away many people’s livelihoods in the near- to medium-term future. While classical economics tells us that disruptive changes in labour mechanics such as offshoring and automation only cause a temporary loss in jobs before there is a “job shift” when people start to work in other fields of endeavour so that they may earn a living, the short-term pain caused by the original job displacement is undeniable. UBI is a well-meaning attempt to alleviate some of that pain. It comes with the same plethora of problems around unemployment doles, but Murthy’s view was that societies have a responsibility to their underprivileged or displaced populaces and that he would welcome higher taxes on the IT industry that are meant to go directly to those whose jobs IT displaces. He said that the only society that is stable is one that is seen to be moving, however haltingly, towards an atmosphere of equity and fairness among all its members.Leaders in the IT industry need to be seen as fair by the people under their command. Giving raises at the top that are 10 or even 20 times the rate of the raises being given at the bottom runs the risk of creating an impression that those at the top are greedy opportunists most interested in snatching what they can while the going is good. I have been part of a company where the boss raised his own salary by over 250%, leaving others in his second line like me to explain to the rest of the workforce that they had to make do with a 2% increase. The rationale for the anaemic salary increase for everyone but the boss was that the firm had not reached its (internally set) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, targets. As an aside, I am sure the boss’s new salary contributed to the company repeating this miss in the next year. That year, even though my own compensation increase was also in the low single digits, I felt great discomfiture at having to justify and explain the boss’s salary increase, which the board had seen right to give him since “he could easily get another job in the industry paying just as much”. To paraphrase the Bard of Avon, all the mouthwash in India has not cured me of the ensuing halitosis from those conversations.Recalling a time when the industry finally saw the light and banded together in the common interest to fight high levels of attrition when companies were blithely poaching talent from one another, I asked Murthy whether Nasscom or some such industry body could now be entrusted with this looming question of “fairness”. He was unequivocal that an ombudsman is needed.

The volume of daily cashless transactions has increased from Rs150 crore to Rs400 crore per day since the 8 November demonetization of high-value banknotes that created a cash crunch.So far, 38,128 retail outlets have been equipped with point-of-sale (PoS) machines. More than 86% of the outlets have infrastructure for digital payment transactions. “Most of the petrol pumps have opted for digital infrastructure such as micro ATMs and e-wallets since demonetization. However, the cashless drive can be accelerated further with the adoption of BharatQR or a standardized quick response (QR) code across all the retail outlets,” said Sunil Kulkarni, deputy managing director, Oxigen Services (India) Pvt. Ltd, a payment company.To incentivize cashless payments, Pradhan said that the government had on 8 December announced a discount of 0.75% for purchase of petrol/diesel through credit/debit cards and e-wallets, at fuel retail outlets run by OMCs. It came into effect from 13 December.The burden of the discount is being borne by state-owned OMCs Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL).The oil ministry tweeted later in the day that it is exploring options to deliver petroleum products to consumers at their doorsteps on pre-booking. “This would help consumers avoid spending excessive time and long queues at fuel stations,” said the tweet.

-0.52,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is seeking to step up the pace of auctioning power-purchase contracts for wind-energy plants, building on a contest that reaped record-low prices for solar farms earlier this month.The government plans to offer deals covering almost 4 gigawatts of wind capacity in the current fiscal year ending March 2018 in addition to 750 megawatts of solar capacity it will tender next month, Ashvini Kumar, managing director at Solar Energy Corp. of India, the country’s implementing agency for renewable targets, told reporters in New Delhi.Modi is seeking to expand renewables to help balance India’s burgeoning needs for electricity against efforts to clear the skies of pollution. The government has a goal to install 175 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2022 and is prodding local authorities to step up the pace of permitting renewables.“The ministry of new and renewable energy has written to all states to indicate their requirement for green power to consolidate demand, as more tenders would be brought out,” Kumar said.SECI, which conducted Asia’s first onshore wind auction in February, received bids to supply wind power for Rs3.46 (5 US cents) a kilowatt-hour, much lower than feed-in tariffs of Rs4 rupees to Rs5 prevailing across India’s most windy states.Also Read: <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/m83GjZAfpnMj2T0sMQNhpJ/Green-energy-firms-explore-portfolio-mergers-to-aid-selloff.html"" target=""_blank"">Green energy firms explore portfolio mergers to aid sell-off</a>According to Kumar, the government thinks that 5 gigawatts to 6 gigawatts of wind capacity can be added every fiscal, and companies could be able to reach the government’s goal over the next four years.Modi’s goal calls for a doubling of India’s wind capacity to 60 gigawatts and a 10-fold increase in solar projects to 100 gigawatts.SECI already has planned to offer 750 megawatts of solar projects next month in the sunny state of Rajasthan, anticipating that contest will bring record-low bids. The auction structure forces companies to compete for contracts to sell power from renewable energy plants, encouraging them to reduce prices.The price of solar power in India fell to a record of Rs3.15 a kilowatt-hour last week in an auction for 250 megawatts earlier this month, besting February’s record of Rs3.30 a unit.“The trend in the market should continue, and I would like to think that the market hasn’t bottomed out,” Kumar said when asked if tariffs in the upcoming project could go below the Rs3 mark.Also Read:<a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Industry/Q5Florefv9lbFwnMQhsXpO/Foreign-investors-giving-MA-deals-in-Indias-renewable-ener.html"" target=""_blank""> Foreign investors giving M&amp;A deals in India’s renewable energy sector a miss</a>Timely payments to investors backing green power also will help bring prices lower, the official said. The industry has a guarantee backed by the states, SECI, and the Reserve Bank of India, which is the national central bank. This agreement has been executed with 23 states, and SECI expects the remaining to come on board soon, he added.India’s green-power ambitions have been at risk from loss-making state-run power retailers that aren’t able to buy enough power and have run behind on payments to several domestic and overseas clean-energy companies, racking up deficits of several hundred million dollars.The upcoming 750-megawatt solar park is split into a 500-megawatt project offering five contracts to build 100 megawatts and a 250-megawatt piece where investors can bid chunks of at least 50 megawatts.Kumar said the larger piece was oversubscribed 11 times and the smaller one by 13 times when the bids were submitted by investors on Wednesday. The firms bidding included companies from the Middle East and other locations new to India’s renewables auctions.Infrastructure development and finance group IL&amp;FS has developed the 500-megawatt solar park by acquiring land for installations and building power evacuation systems, while the same has been done for the remaining 250-megawatt portion by Indian conglomerate Adani group.The solar park charges for the IL&amp;FS group facility are Rs0.42 crore a megawatt, while that for the Adani group’s park are Rs0.36 crore, SECI General Manager Sanjay Sharma said.

Some of the world’s richest people also happen to be combatants in the expensive war over the future of technology in India.Bezos’s Amazon.com Inc. and Indian rival Snapdeal, backed by Son, are spending billions of dollars to build e-commerce in India. Alibaba founder Ma has splurged on investments aimed at popularizing digital payments. Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd is on track to spend about $30 billion (gulp!) to shake up India’s stodgy mobile internet service. Google, Tencent, Uber, Xiaomi, Apple and Facebook are also betting on growth in India.It’s easy to see why India and its 1.3 billion people are the No. 1 prize in technology. About one-quarter of Indians used the internet in 2015, according to the most recently available data from the World Bank, but the percentage is expected to explode in coming years. And compared with China—a quick-to-digitize country that was quicksand for non-Chinese tech companies—India has been relatively open to companies from outside the country.The battle for supremacy is great for Indians, who will get better and cheaper technologies tailored to their needs. But gobs of money are being spent now for what is a very, very long game with an uncertain toll on both winners and losers.ALSO READ: <a href=""http://origin-alpha.livemint.com/Opinion/zwjj98a3gZmVGhMCYUCE3J/Infosyss-Rs13000-crore-payout-falls-short-of-what-investor.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Infosys’s Rs13,000 crore payout falls short of what investors need</a>Apple CEO Tim Cook has said India is seven to 10 years behind China in technology market potential, and other executives echo that view. Building the future involves many, often low-tech, struggles like dealing with bad and clogged roads to deliver online orders, poor internet access for customers and dinged reputations from fears that foreign companies like Facebook are trying to monopolize internet use in the country. But a couple of recent actions—one by the government, the other by a billionaire—have been important developments in India’s tech market. They show how individual actions can be unexpected sparks for technology use and the tech business in India. Spending by India’s richest person on a new mobile network: About $30 billion. First, the decision last year by India’s government to ban the vast majority of cash in circulation did more for adoption of digital payments than anything a rich techie could have done. That move helped payments services like Paytm, backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, but it also gives a leg up to on-demand ride companies, e-commerce and other services that depend on a shift toward electronic payments in a country with low credit card penetration. (India’s central bank on Thursday also cleared Amazon India to start its own digital payments service.) The second jolt was the launch last fall by Ambani, India’s richest person, of a national mobile network that offered free cellphone calls and cheap, fast mobile web surfing. Competitors complained, but they quickly cut customers’ bills, too, and gave them more data. Ambani’s Reliance Jio mobile network signed up about 100 million customers. That is nearly as many customers on contracts with Verizon, the largest wireless company in the US by that measure. And Verizon didn’t get those customers in six months, as Reliance Jio did.Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet Inc.,’s Google, has said the biggest barrier to technology development in India is affordable, available and high-quality internet access, which like in China is mostly done on mobile phones. Ambani has helped bring down that internet access barrier. Technology development in India will be unpredictable and halting, but the potential payoff is too alluring to ignore. Expect the billionaire battle in India to continue.
